The properties of one and more space dimensional solitons are discussed on the basis of the works performed mainly in Dubna at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Laboratory of Computing Techniques and Automation. The conception of near integrable systems is formulated. As an example of interaction of Langmuir solitons it is shown that the Hamiltonian system is able to transform continuously its properties

In [ l 11 (see also [ 3 ] , p. 100) it was shown, that in the systems with so-called saturable non-linearity, there exist stable Qsolitons in a certain region of w . In the framework of the one-

+ D-dimensional Euclidean space or in (D 1)-dimensional
Minkowski world (in the latter case the mass term is renormalized), to the following equation of quite a general type with polynomial Lagrangian.

As has been pointed out, stable Q-solitons (dQ/do < 0) for the
KG3 equation do not exist, when D = 3. The computer experiments carried out at Dubna exhbit the same situation for pulsating solutions of type (3) to eq. (8.3). The KG3-pulsons as well as the KG3 Q-solitons decay by two instability modes
- dissipative and singular [3] .
Solutions to eqs. (8.1) and (8.2) have non-trivial asymptotics (the vacuum values) at infinity (r + w)

to which minima of potentials (10) correspond (function V3(cp) has only one relative minimum V3(0)= 0). Fixation of one of these vacua as a boundary condition may lead to the quasi-
stable (i.e., weakly radiating linear waves) pulsons to occur. Their lifetime is of the order of l o 3 oscillation periods (adiabatic invariant (4)!), Note, that the decay time of a KG3-pulson is of the order of several (3-4) oscillations (for details see [3]).
It should be stressed as well, that no nonradiating objects
similar to the bions in plane (x, r ) world, were found for the
SG equation. We chose the following boundary conditions

Note that for the instanton solutions (xz = a = 0), the condition (6) coincides with the renormability condition of the theory. A similar situation takes place for vector fields

A , =J'(x)x,/luI. For example, when p = 4 , q = 6 , D = 3, we have a set of
solutions cpn (n numbers nodes of the field function) stable in a certain area of parameters w ,gz,a.
The existence theorem for D = 3 and quite a general non-
linearity was proved in [ 141 .
At the end of this section we note, that static properties of solitons were studied for more complex scalar and vector gauge theories such as SU(2) X SU(2), SU(3) X SU(3), as well as including colour spinor (quark) fields, i.e., SU(3) X SU(3) X SU(3) [15] (one of the authors of these investigations, Prof. Lee, has spoken on them).
6. To justify somewhat the title of this report let us proceed again to a computer. The dynamics of solitons in many-dimensional worlds is, so far, almost completely an eparchy of the computer. With its help pulsons-quasi-bions in spherical three-dimensional space have been discovered, and their properties investigated [4]. The ss-solutions of a soliton type were studied for the following equations describing real scalar fields3

Somewhat later analogous objects were found by the group
from ITEP (Moscow) [ 161.
Quasi-stable pulsons of greater and greater field amplitudes in the origin, ~ ( 00,)>2nn might be expected to exist for many-vacuum sineGordon theory. Such objects have been found (although they have no analog in the plane (x, t ) world); their amplitudes lie in the region p(0, t )E (377,477). Then in the region (2n, 3n), these pulsons become unstable. As a result, we have a cascade process: irradiating slightly a heavy pulson diminishes its amplitude inside the interval (3n,4n), rapidly
goes through the interval (2n, 3n),and then, in the area ( n ,2n),
we have again a weakly radiating pulson, which becomes unstable in (0, n).It is easy to notice, that such a pulson behaviour is intimately connected to a potential shape V(q)(Bogolubsky).
To shorten computer run time the initial conditions were taken in the quasi-bion form
p(r, 0) = 4x arctg [tg CY sech (sin w ) ]
with changing parameters a and x . We have just considered the dynamical properties of solitons,
which relate their formation and instability. But a real dynamics, in which particular properties of solitons may be exhibited, indeed, is their interaction.
Let us now proceed to discussing the results known to the author, on collisions Of two space-dimensional cylindrically symmetric ((CS) in each rest frame) solitons. We mention here

The behaviour of Q-solitons in these collisions is very similar to the pure soliton one (when z, +, 1): an interaction turns out to be nearly elastic, and a certain shift in their positions have been observed. In the region of small V z 0.2, we have observed an oscillating bound state of two solitons, apparently, slight radiating. The results of two such experiments are depicted in Figs. 1-4.
