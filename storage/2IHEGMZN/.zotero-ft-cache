Soliton evolution in the presence ofperturbation. V. I. Karpman (Institute for Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radiowave Propagation (IZMIRAN), Moscow Region, 142092, USSR). Physica Scripta (Sweden) 20, 462478,1979.
A perturbation theory for nonlinear waves based on the inverse scattering method is presented. The theory is applied to the description of soliton evolution in the presence of permanent perturbation. It is shown that small perturbation leads to three main effects: (i) a slow change of soliton parameters; (ii) a deformation of its shape ( 5 ) formation of a soliton “tail” which is a small amplitude wave packet with growing length. All these effects are investigated in detail for the Korteweg-de Vries, modified Korteweg-de Vries and nonlinear Schrodinger equations to which perturbation terms of general form are added. It is shown, in particular, that for the last equation, in contrast to the previous two, the tails do not appear for perturbations of a very broad type.

relations connected with it (Section 3). In Section 4 the basic equations of the perturbation theory are derived. These equations govern the time evolution of spectrum and scattering coefficients in the presence of Perturbation. In the next sections we derive their solutions in the first approximation and then restore the solution in the first approximation and then restore the solution of eq. (1.1). For definiteness we consider only three equations - the KdVE, MKdVE and NSE, to which perturbation terms are added (eqs. (5.1), (7.1) and (7.2)). The general equations of perturbation theory are applied to the simplest and the most basic problem, the investigation of the evolution of a soliton-like pulse, which is supposed to be a soliton at the initial moment. The motivation of that stating of the problem is the following. A weak perturbation has small influence on the formation of solitons and their running off. Therefore one can treat solitons as noninteracting, and so consider, as a first step, the action of perturbation on a single soliton (the case of formation of solitons with equal velocities, which may happen for NSE [ 4 ] ,MKdVE, and some others, will be considered elsewhere). Accordingly. there are two time scales in the theory. The first is the soliton time t, which is, by the order of magnitude, the duration of soliton passage of a distance equal to the soliton length. The
- second time is the perturbation time t, corresponding to a signifi-
cant change of soliton amplitude. It appears that t s / t p e, i.e., this ratio is the main dimensionless parameter of the perturbation theory.
One of the important results of the perturbation is the generation of a “tail”: a wave packet of small amplitude following behind, or. in some cases, in front of the soliton. It is important that the tail length increases approximately proportional to the time [17]. A description of the tail structure for the perturbed KdVE is given in Sections 5 and 6. In these sections the soliton deformation is also investigated. In Section 7 these questions are considered for the MKdVE and NSE. It is interesting that for the KdVE and MKdVE the tail formation is a general phenomenon: the tails d o not appear only for special types of perturbations (satisfying the conditions ( 5 . 5 1) and
(7.35). for the KdVE and MKdVE, respectively). On the con-
trary. for the perturbed NSE the tails d o not appear for a very broad class of perturbations (the sufficient condition for that is (7.9)).
In Section 8 we consider the conservation laws in the presence of perturbation. It is known, that nonlinear evolution equations. solvable by the ISM. have infinite number of invariants conserving in time. In the presence of perturbation, however, they are not conserved and we derive equations describing their evolutions
[ 161 . These equations are called the “modified conservation
laws” (MCL). It appears that in the first order of perturbation theory the infinite number of MCL degenerates into rather few independent equations. From the analysis performed in this section, it is clear what information can be obtained from the MCL without solving the initial eq. (1.1).

i.e., the spectrum of &U) does not change in time if i ( u ) obeys the eq. (1.3), i.e.. if the wave field u(x, t ) satisfies the eq. (1.2)

[ I , 21. To consider the eigenfunctions of eq. (2.1), we first suppose
that e ( u ) is the Schrodinger operator (1.5) which is associated with the KdVE (1.4). In this case it is convenient to put h = k 2 and so eq. (2.1) takes the form

a 2 + ~ax

[k2 - u ( x ) ] LJ = 0

(2.5)

(the dependence on time is not written here and in the follow-
ing, unless it is important). As far as u(x) -+ 0 at / xI + m the
continuous spectrum consists of real values of k . Now we introduce the Jost functions f ( x , k ) and g(x, k ) for
the eq. (2.5), defining them as eigenfunctions of i ( u ) satisfying the boundary conditions

(3.6)

The main properties of the Jost’s functions are following

(proofs and more details are given, e.g.. in [ 2 3 ]).

Both functions can be presented in the form

+s, ;a

f(x,k ) = eikx

K(x,1’)e i h y djr

(2.7)

where K , K - are real kernels, and

u(x) = -2 d K k X I

(the corresponding relations for K - are not written here if they are not used).
Parallel with f ( x , k ) and g(x, k ) , eq. (2.5) has the conjugated eigen f u n ct i o n s

f * ( X , k ) = f ( x , - k). g*(x,k ) = g(x, -k )

(2.9)

For k # 0. f*(x, k ) and g*(x,k ) are linearly independent of f(x,k ) ,g(x, k). Therefore

(2.12)

From (2.10) and (2.1 1) one obtains

(2.13)

These relations are complementary to (2.6). By substituting (2.1 1) into (2.10) one gets

la1’ - Ibl’ = 1

(2.14)

The Jost’s function f(x, k ) describes the wave incident from x - = 00 and partly reflected by the potential u(x, t). According to (2.13) and (2.6) the reflection and transition coefficients are
b*(k)/a(k)and l/a(k), and the conservation of the flux gives
lb*/aI2 + ll/aI2= 1 , which is equivalent to (2.14). Similarly,
another Jost function, g(x, k ) , corresponds to the wave incident from x = m with the transition and reflection coefficients l / a and b/a, respectively. The unitary matrix

(2.15)

(2.21)

This relation shows that ab # 0, i.e., all the roots k, are simple.
The inverse scattering method permits to restore the “potential” of the equation (2.5) if the scattering data (i.e., the Jost coefficients a(k) and b(k)),and, also, discrete spectrum is known. To do that one have to find the kernel K(x, s) from the Gel’fand-Levitan-Marchenko (GLM) equation [23-251

jxm + + K(x,y ) + F(x y ) + K(x, s)F(s y ) ds = 0,

(2.22)

where x <y , and

(2.23)

Then, by using (2.8), one finds the potential u(x). Up to now we have not considered the dependence of time.
Let us discuss this question now by supposing that u(x, t) satisfies the unperturbed equation (1.4). Substituting $ = f(x, k; t ) into (2.2) and taking into account (2.4) one has

may be called scattering matrix for the one-dimensional potential
4x1. Consider now the Wronskian

W K 81 = f w a x -g aflax

By taking into account W [ f ,g] = const. and using (2.6) and (2.10) one has

i
Q(k)= - 2k WIf(x, k),g(x, k)l

(2.16)

Up to now we have considered f(x, k ) and g(x, k ) for the real k . Relations (2.7) permit us to continue these functions into the upper half-plane, where they have no singularities. One can see, also, that

(2.17)

Then eq. (2.16) defines the analytical continuation of a(k) and it is evident that a(k) has no singularities in the upper half-plane of k . It follows, also, from (2.17) and (2.16) that

> a ( k )+. 1 (lkl -+ 00, Im k 0)

(2.1 8)

As for the function b(k),it cannot be continued in the complex
plane, in general. From (2.18) it follows that a(k) has only a finite number of
roots in the upper half-plane of k , and it is seen from (2.14) that there are no roots at the real axis. Denote the roots of a(k) in
the upper half-plane as k, (r = 1 , 2 , . . . ,N). Then from (2.16)
it follows that g(x, k,) andf(x, k,) are linearly dependent, i.e.

g(x, kr) = Prf(X9 kr)(a(kr) = 0)

(2.19)

where p r are some numerical coefficients. From (2.6) and (2.19) one can see that f(x, k,) (and, so, g(x, k,)) vanish at x +. f 00, i.e., they are eigenfunctions of discrete spectrum. Hence, X = k: constitute the discrete spectrum and, evidently

k, = iK,, K , > O , r = 1 , 2, . . . ,N
From (2.5) and (2.16) one can also deduce that

(2.20)

-af+ d f = c1f+czf*
at

(2.24)

where c1 and c 2 are constants of integration. Assuming here x += and taking into account (1.6) and (2.6), one has

c1 = -4k3i, c2 = 0

(2.25)

Then, substituting (2.25) and (2.13) into (2.24), one obtains 111

a(k, t ) = a(k, 0); b(k, t ) = b(k, 0) exp (8ik3t)

(2.26)

The same procedure for eigenfunctions of discrete spectrum f(x, ik,, t) gives

P r ( t > = Pi-(o) ~ X (P8 ~ :t )

(2.27)

The obtained relations permit to solve eq. (1.4) for the given initial condition u(x, 0) in the following way.
(i) Calculate the discrete spectrum and Jost coefficients for u(x, 0).
(ii) By using eqs. (2.26) and (2.27) define the spectrum and scattering data for arbitrary t.
(iii) Construct the function F ( s ) (2.23) and find K(x, s) from the GLM equation (2.22).
(iv) Restore u(x, t )by using (2.8). The simplest and most important solution of the KdVE describes the soliton

U,(X, t ) = - 2~’sech’z, Z = K [X - { ( t ) ]
where K is constant and
+ <(t)= 4K3t

(2.28) (2.29)

If one takes (2.28) as a potential for the Schrodinger eq. (2.5), one can solve the latter analytically and the result is (e.g., [26])

+ + f = f,(x, k ) eikx ( k Ki tanh z)(k iK)-l + g = g,(x, k ) e-ikx ( k -Ki tanh z)(k iK1-l

(2.30)

From here it follows that

b(k) = 0,

(2.31)

i.e., the potential (2.28) is “reflectless”. The equation a(k) = 0 has only one root k = iK, which defines the only eigenvalue of discrete spectrum k 2 = - K’. By substituting k = iK into (2.30), one obtains the Jost’s functions of the bound state
4 +fs(x,i K ) = e-KEsechz, gs(x,iK) = pf(x, iK)

For the real X they are connected by the relations

p = exp ( 2 ~ 0

(2.32)

One sees that the time-dependence of p(t), which follows from (2.29) and ( 2 . 3 2 ) , is in agreement with (2.27).
One might act inversely by looking for the Schrodinger equation solution with b(k)= 0 and a(k) having only one root in the upper half-plane of k . Then, from (2.14) one has la(k)l = 1 , and taking into account (2.18) one concludes that a(k) can be written in the form (2.31). Then one defines the function F(s) according to (2.23), (2.26), and (2.27) with arbitrary positive p ( 0 ) according t o (2.21)). By solving the GLM equation (2.22) one obtains the single soliton solution (2.28).
The solution of the Schrodinger eq. (2.5) for arbitrary u(x, 0) gives b(k) $0 and

These formulas are slightly different from the written above for the Schrodinger equation.
The Jost vector-functionf ( x , A) may be represented as

For sufficiently large t this solution decays into a finite number of solitons having the amplitudes 2 ~ a: nd velocities 4 ~ ; .Besides the solitons a wave packet is formed, which is associated with the second term in ( 2 . 2 2 ) , i.e., with the continuous spectrum. and its development is defined by the reflection coefficient

From (2.42) and similar representation for g(x, A) it follows that f ( x , A) and g(x, A) may be continued analytically into the
upper half-plane of A. and they have no singularities if Im X > 0.

following, may be computed directly from that equation. Consider, first, the Schrodinger equation (2.5) where

where p , U, 6 and t are arbitrary real parameters (and u > O ) .
Evidently, A = h, is the only bound state eigenvalue in the upper half-plane. From (2.4) it follows that p and U are time independent and from the last equation of (2.49) and (2.52) one has

Peculiarities of the particular equations have influence only on the function h(A) which defines the time dependence of 6 and

Now it is easy to calculate the eigenfunctions of the operator i ( u , ) . To do that one substitutes (2.56) and (2.57) into (2.42) and obtains after integration

4. Evolution of the spectrum and Jost's coefficients in the presence of perturbations

In the perturbation method under consideration, the perturbed

equation (1.1) is associated with the same linear operator i ( u )

which is attached to the unperturbed equation (1,2). Evidently.

the spectrum, Jost coefficients, etc., as functionals of U are

irrespective of the perturbation. However, their time evolution

in the presence of perturbation differs from that one obtained in

Section 2. In this section we derive equations describing this

evolution by using the approach described in [151 ,

Let F{u) be a functional outcoming from the eigenvalue pro-

blem for the operator &U). Its time derivative may be written

(if U is a real function, the variational derivatives over U * are absent). By taking &/at and au*/at from eq. (1 . I ) one has

If A belongs to the continuous spectrum, the second term in the r.h.s. of (3.12) vanishes and the solution, similar to (3.4), has the form

(One can easily check this by substituting (3.13) into (3.12) and taking into account (2.41)). Expression (3.13) vanishes at x = 03, in accordance with (2.37). By assuming x + - m in (3.13) and taking into account (2.38) and (2.39) one has

where (dF/dt), (aF/at),=, is the functional depending on U
and U * in the same way as d F / d t at E = 0. For instance. according to (2.26), (2.27) one has

6_b_ {u_ : A-} 611(x)

{U; x , A)gl (U; x , A}.

(3.14)

For discrete spectrum, X = A,., the r.h.s. of (3.12) must be

(4.4) In a similar way. proceeding from the eqs. (2.49), one has
[T-)~ &(U, X) = 0. (---d-&b)o(u, h } = ih(X)b{u;h),

orthogonal to the solution of the conjugated homogeneous equation, which is (2.3). Therefore this solution i s 7 = (f;, f : ) .

The orthogonality condition gives

Substituting (3.15) into the equation similar t o (3.9) one obtains after some transformations

The general idea expressed by the equation (4.3) appears to be very fruitful in many cases because it permits us to avoid rather cumbersome algebra.
Let us apply eqs. (4.2)-(4.4) to the eigenvalues and scattering coefficients defined by the Schrodinger operator and perturbed KdVE. Then. taking into account (3.6)-(3.8) and (3.1 1) one has [13, 141

The operator (1.9) has, in general, a complex potential. Therefore one should also know the variational derivatives over
U * . They are obtained from (3.14), (3.15) and (3.16) by substitution

depending on U(X,t ) and, therefore, they depend on time.

Similar equations can be written for other cases. In particular, for the NSE and MKdVE one derives from (4.2), (4.3), (4.5) and (3.14g(3.17) [13, 15,20,21]

which gives (4.8) and (4.16). By substituting the Jost functions into (4.23) one can get also equations for a, b and‘p:. It seems, however, that the first method is somewhat simpler.
The obtained evolution equations for the eigenvalues and scattering coefficients, being exact, constitute a basis for the perturbation theory. They permit us, in principle, to find all the parameters appearing in the GLM equation (2.22) in the
required approximation by using matrix elements LY and p com-
puted in the lower approximation. Then, by finding the kernel k ( x , y ) from the GLM equation one can restore the solution U(X,t).The generality and effectiveness of this approach will be demonstrated in the next sections.

In the unperturbed case (E = 0) the initial pulse U(X,0) decays into a sequence of solitons and a tail. Now suppose that perturbation is so small that it has a negligible influence on the soliton formation. Therefore, the perturbation will manifest itself in affecting the solitons only after rather long time since their appearance. The mutual interaction between the solitons becomes to be unimportant after a time of the order of

t, = (2K)-3

(5.2)

Here ts is the time of soliton movement along the distance of the order of its length (according to (2.28), (2.29)). Evidently, at t 3 t, the soliton may be considered as isolated and if perturbation becomes to be important only for t 3 t,, one may consider the action of perturbation on the single soliton. In what follows we consider this problem in the first approximation.
It appears that some of perturbation effects are accumulated with time. Therefore they cannot be considered as small at sufficiently large t. It will be seen below that one of those effects is the tail formation. It is convenient to consider first the perturbation effects for sufficiently small t (but t S t,). This will be the main object of this section.
Proceeding from this argument we look for the solution of

The first term in (5.3)?u,(z, k ) , is a soliton pulse described by the expression (2.28). However*it is assumed that and dg/dt are not constants but slowly varying functions. The quantities dK/dt. d’[/dt’ and w(z, t ) are considered as small ones of the first order of E . To find them we consider eqs. (4.8). (4.9). (4.12) and (4.13) with matrix elements calculated in the zero approximation.

Hence, the function w(z, t ) is “orthogonal” to the soliton. It this section we restrict ourself by these two conservation laws. (It appears that there exists an infinite sequence of conservation equations. A complete treatment of that question will be given in the eighth section.)
From eq. (5.16) it follows

where it is assumed that a,, f, and g, are defined by (2.30) and

the condition (5.24) is more restricted then t < t,. However.
(5.24) holds, in particular, for t % t,, which means that the tail length may be much larger than that of the soliton. The time interval restricted by (5.24) corresponds to the initial period of the action of perturbation. In this section we find the function 6u of (5.4) for this time interval.

It is worth mentioning that eq. (5.1) is written in the units where U and, consequently, K~ have dimension of velocity, K - ~has dimension of time, and E R [ u ]of K ‘ .

According to (5.9), tp is the time of change of the soliton amplitude.

- with the increasing of the well length (its depth remains t o be
of the same order of magnitude: 6u E ~ K ’ )n, ew bound levels
(with ~f <- € 4 ~ ’ ) appear. This leads to formation of small
solitons with amplitudes of the order of I E ~ / K ’ at sufficiently
large time. However, as follows from the results of the next section, the part of the tail adjoining the soliton kern remains to be a plateau of the order of leql~’/2.
And, finally, it should be noted that by using the perturbation theory of quantum mechanics one can also compute the factor p o . For that one has to calculate the eigenfunction corresponding to k = iKo, After some calculations under the condition (5.24), one comes to (5.30).
Consider now the case q = 0, i.e..

(5.50)

then its magnitude can be calculated by means of the usual quantum mechanical perturbation theory (e.g., [ 2 6 ], section 45). In that calculation the soliton kern may be neglected because its width is much less than that of the wave function

(5.22) and (5.19) one obtains the condition (5.24) which re-

One can check by straightforward integration that (6.4) and

(5.53) are equivalent. It should be also mentioned that (6.4)

may be obtained from (5.42) if one put under the integral of

the last expression exp (i7p3) = 1, which is possible because

of the condition (5.54).

Substituting (6.4) together with (5.41) and (5.43) into (6.2)

and using the identity

A-d [@ +itanhz)’ eziPz] = - 8ip(l + p ’ ) @ t i t a n h z ) ’ elip’
dz (6.5)

and, also, (5.9) and (5.52), one sees that expression (5.41) with (6.4) (i.e. (5.53)) gives the solution of the eq. (6.2). An estimation of an accuracy of this solution follows from the observation that the neglected terms in the r.h.s. of eq. (6.2) may,
- generally, grow with time to become of the order of other
terms at t tp(tp/ts). Hence, the solution represented by the expressions (5.53) and (5.41) is valid for the time interval’

If we put in (5.55) z +--, it gives exactly the expression for
the tail in the plateau region, i.e., w = - q / 2 .
And, finally, it is easy to obtain the kern asymptotics at
large positive z , i.e., in the front of the soliton. From (5.53) at z S 1 one has

significantly at t t, and, then, U, ceases to be the main term in (5.2). Therefore the validity of obtained solution is restricted in this case by

(6.6a)

As was already mentioned, the expressions (5.53) and (5.41)
lead to the soliton disturbance 6u = - 2 ~ w’ depending only on
z and K with the asymptotics (5.55), (5.56). Hence this disturbance moves with the kern velocity d(/dt and its back side turns smoothly to the flat part of the tail

W( -) = - ~ 4 ( t ) / 2

(6.7)

6 . Soliton evolution at the large time

The expressions of the previous section defining 6u were derived
under the restriction (5.24). However, the fact that w does not
explicitly depend on t: in the region (5.54), suggests that the
same expressions for w might be valid in a much larger time interval. To show this rigorously, we substitute the expression

+ U = - 2~’(t)[sech’z w(z)]

(6.1)

into (5.1), supposing that K(t) satisfies the eq. (5.9) and w(z)
(now unknown) has an order of E, and w(z) + 0 at z + -.
Then, after linearization we come to the equation

where E t = dUdt, etc., and

Now one can show that the expression for w(z) defined by

The length Ax of the flat part of the tail is the same as for the

The more remote part of the tail is modulated. If €4 < 0 these

in the figure, however, now BC Ax Q ((t)and the oscilating
part of the tail occupies a part of the region x > 0.

6u E and parameters 7,p , S and d t / d t appearing in (2.58). are slow functions of time. Their evolution may be defined from the eqs. (4.14t(4.3,1).

In the presence of perturbation the invariants I , are no

more conserved. In this section equations governing the time

evolution of I,{u(x, t)] in the presence of perturbation are

derived [ 161 .

As far as W(z)vanishes as z + ?r =, it gives no tail.

Here s is denoted s = CX/T and A(X, p, U) is defined in (7.8). From (7.48) it follows that G(z, t) has originated from the
initial conditions assumed above, and w = W at T % 1. As before,
- one can see that the expression (7.45) for @(z) is valid for
rather a long time t < tP(tP/rsa)nd, at least for t tp.
Thus, the perturbation (under condition (7.9)), acting on the NS soliton, does not lead to the tail formation and soliton changes adiabatically according to eqs. (7.6), (7.7), (7.16) and (7.17). The perturbation also results in some deformation of the soliton shape described asymptotically by W(z). The adiabatic evolution of the soliton was obtained also in [31] for the case where R [ u ] describes the instability or dissipation, and it is in agreement with our general theory.
In conclusion we present, as a simple but important illustration, the case when the perturbation term in (7.1) and (7.2) is &[U] = yu, which corresponds to the simplest case of instability or damping with the growth rate y independent on k. Then for NSE [17]

The expression under the first integral should be the divergence. This can be verified directly in each of the considered particular cases by means of rather cumbersome calculations. There is, however, much more simple and general argumentation. If E = 0, the derivative dl,/dt is an integral of a divergence. As S[u] and Zn{u} do not depend on E , the expression under the
first integral in (8.3) remains to be the divergence at E # 0.
Hence, for our boundary conditions (U + O at ixI -+ m) one has

After substituting (8.7), (8.14). (8.16) and (8.17) into (8.4) we come to the following results.
All MCL (8.4) with even n , in the first order ofperturbation parameter E . give only one equation

By calculating the variation of (8.8) and using (3.6), one has

and with Odd

lead to

(8.18)

Substituting (2.30) into (8.9) and expanding the 1.h.s. of it in the inverse powers of k , we obtain

[611/6U(X)l, = 1

[6zn/6u(x)] = ( 2 ~ ) ? - "s-e~ch2z ( n > 1)

This relations can be obtained, e.g., from (8.8), if one substitues in its 1h.s. the expressions (2.31) and then expand it in the powers of k-' . Substitute, now, the relations (8.7), (8.10) and (8.1 1) into (8.4). The derivative d K l d t appearing in the 1.h.s. of (8.4) is to be taken from (5.9). Then, up to the first order of
E , the first of the eqs. (8.4) gives exactly the eq. (5.16) and the other ones ( n Z 2) come to the only equation

As far as these results are derived for p ( t ) 0, one should con-

sider in (8.18) and (8.19) only perturbations R[u] which give

dpldt = 0. From (7.6) it follows that it is ensured if the pertur-

bation satisfies the condition

(8.20)

Therefore. in this case the r.h.s. of (8.19) vanishes. One can

check that eqs. (8.18) and (8.19) actually satisfied by the

solution 11.' derived in Section 7 [ 171. One should note. also,

that for the real MKdVE (7.1), in addition to the invariants

defined by the eq, (8.13), there exists one m 0 r e ~ 2

(8.12)

Therefore. the infinite set of MCL (8.4) gives, in the first order of perturbation theory, only two equations, (5.16) and (8.12). The first of them is satisfied by our solution, as was already shown in Section 5. Equation (8.12) is also satisfied owing to
(5.18). Consider now MKdVE and NSE. In these cases instead of
(8.8) and (8.1 1) we have [4]

I'rom (7.6) it follows that dp'ldt = 0.

Therefore, the assumption p = 0 gives no restrictions on the generality

of results.

l 2 In (8.13) only invariants related to the complex MKdVE (7.la) appear. It is easy t o see that eq. (7.la) at E = 0 does not lead to the conservation of I , , Therefore, I , is not contained in (8.13).

(8.22)

Substituting (7.3) and (7.10) into (8.22) one gets eqs. (7.30) which is, as was already shown, also satisfied by the solution derived in Section 7.
And, finally, it should be noted that the change rate of soliton amplitude in the presence of perturbation was calculated in some papers (e.g., [34]) from one of the conservation laws. However, the question arises whether the remaining infinite set of MCL may be satisfied by that. From the results given above one can see that in the first order of E only two or three independent equations for the soliton parameters follow from the MCL, and to avoid contradictions it is necessary, in general, to take the tail into consideration. However, for the perturbed NSE, under condition (7.9), the problems associated with the tail disappear because in this case it is not produced.
In conclusion I deeply appreciate E. M. Maslov for helpful co-operation in elaborating many of problems discussed above.

Note added in the proof
After this work had been submitted, there appeared several papers relevant to the problems discussed here. The paper [ 1*] describes the numerical solutions of eq. (6.12) which are in correspondence with the above theory given. In particular, the authors give the same tail amplitude in a vicinity of soliton as (6.18). The numerical results show that the length of the unmodulated part of the tail is even larger than K - ~(tp/t,)”2, indicated in Fig. 1 (which is the minimum unmodulated length of the tail guaranteed by the validity of our theory). It should be noted that in such long tails, as were observed numerically, one can no more neglect the change of the tail height. Since, according to eq. ( 5 . 5 9 , the tail originates from the small vicinity of the soliton kern (of the order of several K - ’ ) , the height of the tail at a given point x in the unmodulated region approximately corresponds to the soliton parameter K(t) where t = t ( x ) , and it has very slow further change because of small gradients. This has also been observed in the numerical experiments,
Many of the problems discussed here were considered also by Kaup and Newell [2*] with similar results. In particular, they give a detailed treatment of eq. (6.13) and derive the “shelf’ very similar to our “tail”.
The authors of [3*] have considered an example of perturbed NSE which did not satisfy the condition (7.9) and compared their approximate solution obtained in the limit case of small soliton amplitude with the results following from eqs. (7.6), (7.7), (7.16) and (7.17) (these equations are valid, approximately, even without condition (7.9)). The authors claimed some discrepancy in results obtained by their and our approaches. However, it could be seen that the disagreement lies outside the region of validity of the both methods.
