There is an increasing need to develop physics-based, high performance mod­ els of the Sun-Earth system — from the solar surface to the Earth's upper at­ mosphere — which can operate faster than real time and which can provide re­ liable predictions of the near Earth space environment based upon solar observa­ tions and upstream solar wind measurements. Taking advantage of the advent of massively parallel computers, sophisticated solution-adaptive techniques, and re­ cent fundamental advances in basic numerical methods we have developed a high performance, multiscale MHD code capable of resolving many of the critical pro­ cesses in the Sun-Earth system which range over more than 9 orders of magnitude. We report on the first comprehensive numerical simulation of a "synthetic" space weather event, starting with the generation of a CME and subsequently following this transient solar wind disturbance as it evolves into a magnetic cloud and travels through interplanetary space towards Earth where its interaction with the terrestrial magnetosphere-ionosphere system is also predicted as part of the simulation.

"Space Weather" has been used to refer to the conditions on the Sun and in the solar wind, magnetosphere, iono­ sphere, and thermosphere that can influence the performance and reliability of space-borne and ground based technologi­ cal systems or can endanger human life or health. A major goal of space weather research is to unify our physical under­ standing of the Sun-Earth system into a more comprehensive mathematical framework that can predict the deterministic properties of space weather.
Global computational models based on first principles represent a very important component of efforts to under-

stand the intricate processes coupling the Sun to the geospace environment. The hope for such models is that they will eventually fill the gaps left by measurements, extending the spatially and temporarily limited observational database into a self-consistent global understanding of our space environ­ ment. Presently, and in the foreseeable future, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are the only models that can span the enormous distances present in the magnetosphere. However, it should not be forgotten that even generalized MHD equations are only a relatively low-order approxima­ tion to more complete physics; they provide only a simpli­ fied description of natural phenomena in space plasmas.
This paper describes our multiscale MHD model and its application to the Sun-Earth system. The code itself is de­ scribed in Section 2; the application of the code to simulate a "synthetic" space weather event is described in section 3.

2. SIMULATION CODE
2.1. Description of BATS-R-US
The BATS-R-US code solves the governing equations of magnetohydrodynamics. All terms describing deviations 169

from ideal MHD are included through appropriate source terms. A detailed description of the code can be found in Powell et al, [1999], Groth et al, [1999a] and De Zeeuw et al, [2000]. The code uses a limited reconstruction that ensures second-order accuracy away from discontinuities, while simultaneously providing the stability that ensures nonoscillatory solutions. In addition, the code employs two accurate approximate Riemann solvers: Roe's [1981] scheme [Powell et al, 1999] and Linde's [1998] solver. The result­ ing scheme solves for the hydrodynamic and electromag­ netic effects in a tightly coupled manner, yielding a scheme that works equally well across a range of several orders of magnitude in plasma (3.
The basic data structure used in the BATS-R-US approach is that of adaptive blocks [Stout et al, 1997, Powell et al, 1999]. Adaptive blocks partition space into regions, each of which is a regular Cartesian grid of cells, called a block. If the region needs to be refined, then the block is replaced by 8 child subblocks (one for each octant of the parent block), each of which is a Cartesian grid of cells containing the same number of cells as the parent block. If coarsening is needed, then the 8 children are replaced by their parent. The blocks in the grid, at their various levels of refinement, are stored in a tree-like data structure.
2.2. Non-Ideal MHD Terms
Ideal MHD is based on the asssumption that the plasma is in local thermodynamic equilibrium. An immediate conse­ quence of this assumption is that no dissipative process can be described by ideal MHD. Even non-ideal MHD equations are only a relatively low order approximation to more com­ plete physics. These equations replace a detailed descrip­ tion of the micro-physics with transport coefficients such as diffusion coefficients, resistivity, and viscosity. In high Reynolds number flows (such as the magnetosphere) viscous effects are usually negligible. However, resistivity and dif­ fusion play important roles in some critical regions of the magnetosphere, and therefore these effects must be included in realistic simulations.
Spatial discretization (an essential element of all numer­ ical solutions) results in numerical dissipation which can mimic the appropriate physical processes. However, numer­ ical resistivity and diffusion in high-resolution modern codes are quite low, and the inclusion of physics-based empirical dissipation coefficients is important. Resistivity is of par­ ticular importance, because it controls the rate of magnetic reconnection which is a very important element of the solar wind interaction and global magnetospheric configuration.
Non-ideal MHD processes are included in our MHD model through appropriate terms in the source vector.

2.3. Simulation Domain
The computational domain used in the space weather cal­ culation is a heliocentric rectangular box defined by —32 R 0 < x < 224 R 0 , - 1 9 2 R 0 < y < 192R0, - 1 9 2 R 0 < z < 192 R 0 . The adapted computational grid for the initial solu­ tion of the solar wind (which is a steady-state solution in the corotating frame) consists of 15,768 self-similar 4 x 4 x 4 blocks and 1,009,152 cells with 8 refinement levels and a minimum cell size at the solar surface of 1/16 R 0 . During the time-dependent calculation of the CME, the grid dynam­ ically adapted to the varying solution according to the refine­ ment criteria and the size of the computational mesh varied from under 800,000 cells to in excess of 2,000,000 cells. The length of the entire simulation was 120 hours starting from the initiation of the CME (t = 0).
The procedure for prescribing boundary conditions at the solar surface is dependent on local flow conditions. Plasma can freely leave the reservoir, but no "backflow" is allowed. In addition, no deviation is allowed form the intrinsic mag­ netic field at the interface. At the outer boundaries of the rectangular solution domain, the solar wind flow is essen­ tially super-fast (and hence super-Alfvenic). Simple zerogradient or constant extrapolation boundary conditions are therefore appropriate and are used to specify the plasma properties at the outer boundary. A detailed description of the boundary conditions can be found in Groth et al, [2000].
The resolution of the initial computational grid at Earth is approximately 10 R 0 , but during the passage of the inter­ planetary transient this resolution increased by about a fac­ tor of four. The embedded magnetosphere is simulated in a moving computational box defined by — 384 R E < x < 128RE, -128RE < y < 128RE, -128RE < z < 128RE with 8 levels of refinement, 2004 self-similar blocks of 4 x 4 x 4 cells and 128,256 computational cells. The magneto­ sphere is "turned on" for a total of 27 hours starting at t = 70 h.
The inner boundary of the magnetosphere simulation is a sphere at 3 R E . This sphere is connected to the heightintegrated electrostatic ionosphere.
2.4. Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling
The coupling between the magnetosphere and the iono­ sphere is taken into account through an electrostatic iono­ sphere model. It is assumed that magnetospheric field-alig­ ned currents can penetrate into the height-integrated elec­ trostatic ionosphere, where the current closure is calculated with the help of Ohm's law using a height-integrated con­ ductivity (conductance) tensor. The model directly relates the normal component of the magnetospheric currents enter­ ing the ionosphere through the magnetosphere-ionosphere

interface to the electrostatic potential distribution in the iono­ sphere. Once the ionospheric electrostatic potential is de­ rived, one can calculate the ionospheric convection velocity, which is used as boundary condition for the magnetosphere simulation at the magnetosphere-ionosphere interface.
2.5. Applications ofBATS-R-US
BATS-R-US has been extensively applied to global nu­ merical simulations of the Sun-Earth system Groth et al, [1999a], Gombosi et al, [2000c], Groth et al [2000], the coupled terrestrial magnetosphere-ionosphere Gombosi et al, [1998], Gombosi etal [2000a], Gombosi etal, [2000c], Song et al, [1999], Song et al, [2000], and the interaction of the heliosphere with the interstellar medium Linde et al, [1998].
3. A SYNTHETIC SPACE WEATHER EVENT
3.1. The Inner Heliosphere Near Solar Minimum
An initial solution representative of the state of the solar wind before the initiation of the CME is required as a start­ ing point for this simulation of a space weather event. A "pre-event" solution has been developed for these purposes using the BATS-R-US simulation code which attempts to re­ produce many of the observed global features of solar corona and the inner heliosphere for conditions near solar minimum.
Global computational models based on first principles mathematical descriptions of the physics represent a very important component of efforts to understand the initiation, structure, and evolution of CMEs. Recent examples of the application of MHD models to the study of coronal and solar wind plasma flows include the studies by Steinolfson [1994], Mikic and Linker [1994], Suess et al, [1996], Wang et al, [1998], Guo and Wu [1998], Lionello et al, [1998], Dryer [1998], and Odstrcil and Pizzo [1999].
In the first part of our simulation we attempted to repro­ duce the three-dimensional bulk features of the solar wind for solar minimum conditions. We applied the BATS-RUS simulation code to solve the three-dimensionsional ideal MHD equations from the solar surface to beyond Earth's or­ bit. BATS-R-US has the capability to include the effects of solar rotation, solar gravity, a multipole intrinsic magnetic field (up to octupole), as well as including user-defined volu­ metric sources of mass, momentum and energy. This feature is very important in the present simulation, since BATS-RUS solves the full MHD energy equation and uses 7 = 5/3 for the ratio of specific heats (since ideal MHD assumes per­ fect gases).
For the purposes of the present simulation, it is assumed that at the top of transition region, at a radial distance of 1

R 0 , the base of the solar corona is a large rigidly rotating reservoir of hot, stationary plasma with an embedded mag­ netic multipole field. The plasma temperature (the sum of the ion and electron temperatures) in the reservoir is taken to be T 0 = 2.85 x 106 K and the plasma density is assumed to b e n 0 = 1.5 x 1 0 8 c m - 3 .
The intrinsic solar magnetic field at the solar surface is de­ fined in terms of a multipole expansion that includes terms up to the octupole moment. In the present simulation there was no quadrupole moment, while the octupole and dipole were tilted in the (x, z) plane of the corotating coordinate system. The magnetic axis tilt angle was —15° and the solar magnetic field was azimuthally symmetric about the mag­ netic axis. The surface field strength was 8.4 G at the mag­ netic poles and 2 G at the solar magnetic equator.
In our simulations we used a volumetric heating function to mimic the combined effects of energy absorption above the transition region, heat conduction (which is not included in ideal MHD) and radiative losses. Presently, the physi­ cal understanding of these processes is quite limited, there­ fore one has considerable freedom in choosing the volumet­ ric heating function. Our approach is to reverse the prob­ lem and see whether one can find a heating function which results in reasonable plasma parameters near the Sun and around 1 AU. We adopted a heating function that includes both local energy depositions and losses, thus mimicking the real situation in the lower corona. Specifically, the heating function was assumed to be proportional to (T0 — T), where T 0 is a prespecified "target" temperature. We have chosen T0 = 1.75TQ inside the coronal hole and T0 = T 0 outside (the coronal hole boundary was at 72.5° latitude). We note that our heating function has a sharp gradient at the edge of the coronal hole, however, the resolution of the compu­ tational grid (about 5° near the Sun) limits the sharpness of the transition. Finally, the heating scale-height slowly varies from about 4.5 RQ near the equator to about 9 RQ at the poles. Overall, the motivation for this choice of heat­ ing function was to reproduce many of the observed global plasma properties of the solar wind. A detailed description of the heating function is given in Groth et al, [2000].
Plate 1 shows a 3D representation of the initial solution for the pre-event solar wind near the Sun. The solution is shown in the meridional and equatorial cuts (the (x,z) and (x,y) planes, where the z axis is along the rotation axis, while the magnetic axis is in the (x,z) plane). The color code repre­ sents the logarithm of the magnitude of the magnetic field (in units of G) in the two planes. Solid lines are magnetic field lines: magenta denotes the last closed field lines, red is open field lines expanding to the interplanetary medium just above the heliospheric current sheet, and finally, white lines show open magnetic field lines in the (y, z) plane.

172 MHD SIMULATIONS OF SPACE WEATHER

The narrow dark blue region in Plate 1 is the beginning of the heliospheric current sheet. It originates around 4 RQ where the equatorial portion of the closed magnetic field lines become highly stretched, and extends throughout the entire solution. The current sheet is warped and tilted due to the combined effect of magnetic tilt and rigid solar rotation.
The solution, which is dictated by the complex balance of pressure, magnetic, gravitational, and inertial forces, has re­ gions of open and closed magnetic field lines and leads to the formation of a "helmet" streamer magnetic streamer config­ uration with associated neutral point and equatorial current sheet. The solution correctly mimics some of the dual state features of the solar wind. It produces fast solar wind (~ 800 km/s) above ~ 30° heliolatitude, slow (~ 400 km/s) solar wind near the solar equator, and provides reasonable values for the solar wind temperature and density and interplanetary magnetic field at 1 AU.
Overall, our initial condition represents a very reasonable description of three-dimensional inner heliosphere for solar minimum conditions. We used physically reasonable input parameters near the Sun and were able to obtain a solution out to 1 AU which is in good overall agreement with average observed solar wind conditions.
3.2. Simulation of a CME
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are highly transient solar events involving the expulsion of mass and magnetic field from the solar surface. On the order of 1 0 1 2 kg of plasma may be expelled from the solar surface during a typical event. These dynamic events originate in closed magnetic field regions of the corona. They produce large-scale recon­ figuration of the coronal magnetic field and generate large solar wind disturbances that, as mentioned above, appear to be the primary cause of major geomagnetic storms at Earth.
The physical mechanisms involved in the initiation of CMEs are not well understood. After release, CMEs ac­ celerate and become part of the outward flow of the solar wind. They are either accelerated by the solar wind so as to come into equilibrium with the ambient wind or act as drivers moving faster than the background solar wind. Close to the Sun, the typical dimension of a CME is less than a so­ lar radius. As the CMEs propagate outward from the corona, they expand dramatically and may extend over tenths of an AU by the time Earth's orbit is reached at 1 AU. Moreover, many, if not all, CMEs are associated with magnetic clouds and the plasma properties within these clouds can differ sub­ stantially from those of the ambient solar wind.
Global computational models based on first principles mathematical descriptions of the physics represent a very important component of efforts to understand the initiation, structure, and evolution of CMEs. Here we show our nu­ merical results for a CME driven by local plasma density

enhancement. This initial condition represents a simplified model of the situation just before eruption, when significant amount of mass is elevated into the lower corona. Later, we will apply more sophisticated initial conditions. At this time we just wanted to initiate a mass ejection and see how it moves through interplanetary space. In this calculation, the background solar wind solution described above was used as an initial solution and then a localized isothermal den­ sity enhancement was introduced at the solar surface just above the equatorial plane (as a consequence of the isother­ mal assumption the plasma pressure was also increased by the same factor as the density). This localized isothermal density enhancement initiated the CME. In this enhancement the density and pressure are locally increased by a factor of 135 in a small region just above the solar equator for a dura­ tion of about 12 hours.
Plate 2 shows a three-dimensional representation of the magnetic field configuration 9 hours after the initiation of the CME. The color code represents log(B), white lines are open magnetic field lines, magenta lines represent magnetic field lines with both ends connected to the Sun. At this time the density enhancement is in the declining phase, but it is still more than 100 times higher than the background den­ sity. The density enhancement first leads to the "filling" of the closed magnetic field lines with additional plasma and subsequent expansion of the closed field line region. One can see that the closed field lines became greatly stretched by the outward moving plasma. This is due to the fact that the plasma (3 (the ratio of the kinetic and magnetic pressures) is quite large and the magnetic field is "carried" by the out­ ward moving plasma. We also note the decrease of magnetic field strength behind the leading edge of the outward moving disturbance.
A very interesting aspect of simulation results is the an­ isotropic expansion of the CME. The CME is fairly concen­ trated near the disrupted heliospheric current sheets, while it is broadly spread in the equatorial plane.
3.3. Interaction with the Magnetosphere
The magnetosphere is a complex nonlinear system. The direction of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) funda­ mentally controls the large-scale topology of the magneto­ spheric configuration. The magnetospheric topology in turn controls the entry of mass, momentum, energy, and magnetic flux into the magnetosphere. The entry of these physical quantities from the solar wind into the magnetosphere pro­ duces various transition layers, the extended geomagnetic tail and the plasma sheet, current systems and auroral phe­ nomena.
Three-dimensional global MHD simulations have been used for a long time to simulate the global magnetospheric

configuration and to investigate the response of the magne­ tosphere-ionosphere system to changing solar wind condi­ tions. The first global-scale 3D MHD simulations of the so­ lar wind-magnetosphere system were published in the early 1980s. Since then, global 3D MHD simulations have been used to study a range of processes [Ogino and Walker\9S4, Lyon et al, 1986, Ogino 1986, Ogino et al, 1986, Fedder and Lyon 1987, Watanabe and Sato 1990, Usadietal, 1993, Walker et al, 1993, Fedder et al, 1995a,b, Berchem et al, 1995, Rader et al, 1995, Tanaka 1995, Janhunen and Koskinen 1997, Raederetal, 1997, Winglee etal, 1997, Gombosi etal, 1998, 2000a, White etal, 1998].
Here, for the first time, we simulate the dynamic response of the global magnetospheric configuration to changing so­ lar wind conditions self-consistently simulated all they way from the Sun to 1 AU. The solar wind changes at the location of the Earth due to the rotation of the tilted solar magnetic field and due to the passage of the coronal ejection described in the previous section.
In the simulation Earth is assumed to move on a perfectly circular orbit about the Sun with an orbital radius of 215.5 Rs and an orbital period of 365.25 days. The orbital plane is assumed to be inclined at an angle of 7.25° to the solar equator with a node line aligned with the rc-axis and the max­ imum and minimum excursions of the planet in z-direction occurring in the y = 0 plane. Earth's initial position at t = 0 in the numerical simulation is heliolatitude 7.24° and longi­ tude 11.9° (the CME takes place at 0° longitude and 11.5° latitude).
At this position Earth is located near the heliospheric cur­ rent sheet when the CME is initiated. At Earth's location the first signatures of the CME can be seen in the magnetic field components at around 55 hours after initiation. The driving mass (the piston) arrives around 72 hours after the begin­ ning of the event. The By component of the magnetic field remains pretty steady during the entire event, its value only changes by ~ 0.5 nT. The Bx and Bz components, however, exhibit a significant rotation around the y axis. This, in ef­ fect, is the signature of the passage of a CME-related flux rope. During the event the magnitude of the IMF increases from about 2 nT to approximately 4 nT. A more detailed de­ scription of the solar wind parameters at 1 AU is given in Groth et al, [2000].
The plasma temperature (Te + Tp) in the background so­ lar wind is about 2 x 105K. During the CME (beginning at around 55 hours) the plasma temperature significantly de­ creases dipping below 1.5 x 105K. The solar wind veloc­ ity remains nearly radial during the entire event with the speed gradually decreasing from about 550 km/s to about 450 km/s. The undisturbed solar wind density is fairly high before the CME event (~ 38 c m - 3 ) , but it decreases to a more typical value of ~ 18 c m - 3 just at the arrival of the pis­

ton. At the peak of the event the density increases to about 45 c m - 3 . The solar wind dynamic pressure increases from its pre-CME value of 2.25 nP (at 72 hours) to 4.6 nP at the peak of the event.
Plate 3 shows the change of the global magnetospheric configuration during the passage of the CME event. The Plate shows two 3D snapshots at t = 70.5h and 94.5h. The color code represents the electric current density in the plane of the terrestrial equator, solid lines show last closed mag­ netic field lines. One can see the magnetopause current (or Chapman-Ferraro current) near the subsolar magnetopause and the tail current on the nightside.
The global magnetospheric configuration is primarily con­ trolled by the Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field. For Bz < 0 the magnetosphere exhibits an open con­ figuration with significant dayside reconnection and open magnetic field lines connected to large regions near the mag­ netic poles. For strong northward IMF conditions (Bz > 5 nT) the magnetosphere becomes practically closed with magnetic reconnection limited to small regions near the cusps, For "intermediate" values of Bz (between about 0 and 5 nT) the global magnetospheric configuration is "partially closed" (or "partially open"). This configuration is characterized by significant dayside reconnection and large open cusps, by a narrow near-Earth reconnection line around the cen­ ter of the magnetotail (the length of this reconnection line decreases with increasing Bz), and by long, stretched mag­ netospheric wings connected to the dawn and dusk sides of the ionosphere. These magnetic wings are formed by highly stretched closed magnetic field lines. They represent the transition from magnetopause reconnection to tail reconnec­ tion. In Plate 3 the last closed filed lines at the magneto­ sphere are shown by green, while the last closed field lines in the tail are shown by red.
During the simulated CME event Bz varies between about 0 nT and 3 nT, therefore the global magnetospheric config­ uration never switches to pure "South" or "North" config­ uration. However, the magnetosphere significantly changes during the event. As the solar wind dynamic pressure in­ creases the dayside magnetopause moves inward and the current densities significantly increase. In addition, the mag­ netosphere becomes narrower and the length of the magnetic wings increases from about 60 RE to 90 RE. Overall, the energy and magnetic flux stored in the magnetosphere in­ creased substantially.
A very interesting feature seen in Plate 3 is the clock­ wise "twist" of the magnetosphere perpendicular to the solar wind direction. This twist, which is particularly visible in the wings, is due to the presence of a non-zero By compo­ nent.
Plate 4 shows the change of ionospheric potential and con­ vection pattern during the CME event. The color code repre-

sents the calculated electric potential in the height-integrated ionosphere, white lines show ionospheric convection pat­ terns. One can see the two-cell pattern of ionospheric con­ vection typical for southward-type IMF conditions. The con­ vection pattern is also "twisted" due to the presence of a non­ zero IMF By component. The most important change in the ionosphere is the doubling of the cross-cap potential drop from 30 kV at 70.5h to 60 kV some 27 hours later.
Overall, the terrestrial consequences of the simulated space weather event were not "dramatic" due to our choice of ini­ tial conditions to drive it. During the event the Bz com­ ponent of the interplanetary magnetic field never exceeded + 1 nT, therefore the geoeffectiveness of the CME was quite small. However, the capabilities demonstrated by doing the calculation are themselves dramatic, and nothing precludes us from using the code to simulate more geoeffective events, and ultimately even for forecasting real storms in space. This will be the focus of our upcoming investigations.
