In this report we would like to discuss the properties of ion acoustic solitons. A soliton is a nonlinear perturbation that exhibits a remarkable and characteristic property: after a collision, the emerging solitons have the same shape they had before the collision. By analogy with other quantum quantities which are also conserved, the name soliton was coined to define

its capability of exciting large amplitude ion waves without

generating pseudo-waves [111. A high temperature ratio Te/T

ensures that an initial perturbation can propagate and break into

solitons that are only slightly damped. The absence of pseudo-

waves simplifies the interpretation of the experimental data. In

the Ikezi et al. experiment [9], a large positive potential pulse is

to produce solitons. Ikezi [12] has shown that a sinusoidal

nonlinear acoustic wave also gives solitons. Furthermore, the

pulse is a soliton. By converting the DP into a Triple Plasma, Ikezi et al. [9] provide direct experimental confirmation of their nature. Solitons were generated at the two ends of the target plasma and interact at the center. After the collision the two emerging pulses retain their original shape (Fig. 4). This experimental evidence undoubtedly confirms that the observed nonlinear structures are solitons. It is also worth noting that, in agreement with the prediction of the KdV equation (19), only compressional pulse breaks into solitons. A large negative voltage pulse applied t o the source plasma will produce a wave train in the target plasma. i.e.. a perturbation, the amplitude of which swings from positive to negative.
The number of solitons which evolve from a given initial
perturbation has been studied by numerous authors [11- 141 .
According to the inverse scattering method [6] which is used to solve analytically the KdV equation (19), the number of solitons is given by the number of bound states of the associated Schroedinger equation:

recurrence phenomena were also observed. The wave first breaks into solitons. However, at further distances the original wave form was restored (Fig. 5 ) . A train of solitons can also be obtained in the target plasma of a DP device when a ramp excitation [16] is applied to the source plasma. For small applied voltage, the resulting structure looks like a collisionless shock [17], with a “shock front” and an oscillatory train. However, it has been verified numerically by Tran et al. [18]
that under experiment conditions of [161 , the so called “laminar shock” is in fact a train of solitons. A similar con-
clusion was reached by Gurevich and Pitaevski 1191, who have studied analytically the solution of the KdV equation with a step function as an initial perturbation.
In conclusion, many experimental results did confirm the prediction of the simple KdV equation. However, quantitiative discrepancies exist between theory and experiment. The different theoretical models which will be reviewed in the next chapters give a closer agreement.

3. Finite ion temperature effects on solitons
In a real plasma, the effect of finite ion temperature cannot be neglected: in a DP device, the electron t o ion temperature is of the order of 10-20. These effects can be described by either a fluid or a kinetic theory. In the fluid model, the momentum equation (4) is modified t o

was applied to the source plasma: the determination of the

number of bound state of eq. (24) is just a classical problem of

quantum mechanics. However, a square pulse is seldom used where an adiabatic equation of static for the ion was assumed. experimentally: coupling problems distort the applied signal. By the same method as the one used t o derive the KdV equation Usually a sinusoidal voltage pulse is applied t o the source (19), a KdV equation with modified coefficient is readily plasma. An analytical solution t o this problem has been dis- obtained [20, 21 J . cussed by Ikezi [12]. A qualitative agreement was found:

the higher the amplitude of the initial perturbation, the larger

the number of solitons. However, the number of observed

solitons is higher than the one predicted theoretically. A better agreement between theory and experiment can be found if ion temperature effects are included in the KdV equation [13].
Although many of the previously mentioned experiments [9, 11, 12, 141 involve the use of DP device, nonlinear ion acoustic perturbation can be launched by other methods. Cohn and MacKenzie [15] used photoionization t o produce a large localized density perturbation in a background plasma. Watanabe [13] launches large amplitude perturbation using the conventional grid excitation. In both cases, an initial compressional pulse was observed to break into solitons.

For a typical value of Te/Ti 10- 15, eq. (28) gives only a slight increase of M and does not account for the observed discrepancy between theory and experiment.

the nonlinear equations (3), (19), ( 5 ) , and (6). The method was originally used by Moiseev and Sagdeev 1171 in their treatment of soliton and collisionless shock waves. Instead of looking for a nonlinear equation for space and time evolution of the perturbation, it is much simpler to search only for a stationary soliton of the fluid equations in a frame moving at a certain velocity M. No development in power series [cf. eqs. (8&(10)] is performed. The solutions, when they exist, are therefore valid up to amplitudes much larger than those described by the KdV equation. However, no information about the space-time evolution of an initial perturbation can be obtained.

The electrons can now be separated into two categories: the

free electrons and the trapped electrons. To describe the electron

motion of a particle in the potential U(@):in this analogy, @

(31) then gives @ as a function of x. The dependence of M

vs. the soliton amplitude is given by

The use of relation (33) gives a better fit between theory and experiment as shown in Fig. 6 [131.
Many effects of finite ion temperature cannot be described by a fluid model. Kinetic effects have been discussed by various authors [23-261. Ion Landau damping [25] as well as electron Landau damping [23] contribute to damp out the soliton. Due to the distribution in energy of the ion, ions with a kinetic energy less than the potential energy of the perturbation will be reflected. Experimentally, a precursor or reflected ion is observed in many experiments [9, 12-15]. A detailed discussion of the importance of ion Landau damping and ion reflection can be foundin [25] and [26].

4. Trapped electron effect

The electron behaviour is also strongly modified by the nonlinear potential of the soliton. It is usually assumed that electrons are isothermal during the passage of solitons [cf. eq. ( 5 ) ] . This assumption is only valid if they can be thermalized by collisions with the wall of the device [9]. If this constraint is released, electron trapping in the soliton potential may well
occur, provided the bounce period vbl is smaller than the

Note the flattening of the distribution function a t low energy when it is measured in a soliton. This phenomena is characteristic of the presence of trapped particles.

The introduction of a second ion species in a plasma modifies the ion acoustic wave properties in the linear as well as in the nonlinear regime. In the linear regime, there now exist two ion acoustic modes [35], called the light and heavy ion modes; they are the modification of the modes which exist in the plasma of

showed a good agreement between theory and experiment.

In the nonlinear regime, White et al. [38] have discussed the

stationary solutions of the fluid equation which describes a

two component plasma, for example an Ar-He plasma. Two

different types of structure were found, depending on the

amplitude of the nonlinear perturbation. In a one component

plasma, the fluid equations admit soliton solution only if the

kinetic energy of the ions is sufficient to allow them to over-

come the potential hill @ of the soliton. In a two component

plasma, soliton solutions are found, provided @ is small enough

so that both the light and heavy ions can overcome the potential

hill. In contrast to the one component case, stationary solitons

still exist in the case where CP is high enough to reflect the light

ions but not the heavy ions. The latter type of solution is not

a soliton but a collisionless shock wave since the upstream

region has different characteristics than the downstream one.

In the upstream region, the shock pushes ahead all the light

ions, which are consequently absent in the downstream region.

Extensions of Tran and Hirt's work [ 3 9 ]have been performed by Tran [40] to include ion temperature effect, by Tagare [41] who took into account the effects of multi-species of positive as well as negative ions.
An experimental investigation of the properties of ion acoustic soliton in an Ar-He plasma has been performed by Tran and Hollenstein [42]. It was shown that in an Ar plasma the introduction of a few percent of light ion is sufficient to prevent the soliton formation (Fig. 12). Ion Landau damping and ion reflection by the potential hill have both increased since the added He ions are resonant with the perturbation: these two processes are responsible for the non-formation of the soliton. The introduction of Ar ions in an He plasma affects the soliton formation much less. Experimentally solitons were observed in He plasma containing up to 30% of Ar. The detailed
study of the relation between M and Sn leads to the conclusion
that fluid models such as the KdV equation cannot fit the experimental data. A kinetic treatment which correctly describes the reflected ions has been used by Tran and Hollenstein [42] to interpret their data.

In Section 5 we have shown that stationary solutions of kinetic equations for ion waves in the limit T, S did exhibit different properties whether or not terms of order higher than quadratic were included. The limitation of the method presented in Section 5 is obvious: it does not allow us to study the evolution of an initial perturbation nor the interaction of many solitons. Indeed, recent theories [43-451 did allow us to predict the evolution of an initial perturbation when higher order terms of the expansion (8)-(10) are used. In the following we shall present the discussion of Ichikawa et al. 1431 on the effect of the cubic term.

Turning now to the head on collision of two solitons, one must notice that in contrast to the case of the KdV equation where, aside from some phase shift, the soliton velocities are conserved, there exist now an acceleration of the smaller soliton and a deceleration of the larger one (Fig. 15). In another case where the amplitude of the two colliding solitons are similar, it was observed that the clouds rearrange themselves to equalize the amplitude of the colliding pairs.

This equation is much less known than the KdV equation (19).

However as noticed by Broer and Sluijter [49] it describes much

better t h e behaviour of wave with large k. Therefore the approxi-

mate Hamiltonian Ha has a larger domain of validity than the

one which would lead to the KdV equation.

A nonlinear equation can then be written simply by adding to eq. (87) a nonlinear term a/ax(@)" which is similar to the nonlinear term in the KdV equation:

8.3. Effect o f dissipation
The KdV equation (19) and the various other equations we have just discussed did not include any dissipation. As it has been shown [51], dissipation did lead to new phenomena in soliton formation: not only does the soliton amplitude decrease while it propagates, but also a tail is formed behind it.
The two equations which were solved numerically in [51] were KdV-Burgers equation:

Equation (88) approaches the usual Boussinesg equation in the

limit of long wave length k < 1:

ar Maxon and Vicelli [53] have derived a modified KdV equation for ion acoustic solitons in cylindrical geometry:

a two component plasma has also been performed by Maxon [55]. As for one dimensional solitons, it was found that the introduction of a second ion species reduces the soliton amplitude.
To verify the existence of cylindrical solitons, Hershkowitz and Romesser [56] built a modified DP device, with a geometry that allows the excitation of cylindrical ion acoustic perturbations. As in the one dimensional case, only a compressional pulse evolves into solitons.

9. Conclusion

The stretched coordinates t and 77 are defined by

7 = E3/2t

(104)

In spherical coordinates, eq. (39) is only slightly modified into (Maxon and Vicelli [54]):

The method used to derive eqs. (102) and (105) is analogous to that used by Washimi and Taniuti [2] to derive the KdV equation in the one dimensional case.
The evolution of a cylindrical soliton is reported in Fig. 17. The main difference between the one dimensional soliton and a cylindrical or spherical one is the presence of a residue which is left behind the advancing spherical or cylindrical solution. Characteristic properties of one dimensional solitons have also been found in cylindrical or spherical solitons: the shape of cylindrical or spherical solitons is conserved after a collision. It was also verified that compressional pulse did break into many solitons and a wave train.
A theoretical study of the properties of cylindrical solitons in

As in other fields of physics, the study of solitons in plasma physics has received a great interest from both theoreticians and experimentalists. Narrowing our field of study to only one type of wave in plasma, the ion acoustic wave, we have presented a review of theories and experimental measurements on ion acoustic solitons. From a theoretical point of view, it appears that the dynamics of dressed solitons as well as the study of tail formation are now the two main fields of interest [33, 571. However, from the experimental side [58, 591, no clear cut experiments have been performed to determine what are the most important effects which affect the ion acoustic soliton behaviour. As we have seen, many candidates have been proposed: trapped electrons in the potential of the soliton, finite ion temperature with or without effect of cubic or higher order nonlinearity, ion reflection by the potential and Landau damping. We believe that all of these effects play some role in the soliton dynamic and that, in contrary to what has been done, one should try to formulate a theory which would include them all.
