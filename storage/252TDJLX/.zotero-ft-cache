IN THE HELICAL WIGGLER

Abstract
We have studied behaviour of electron beam in combined a self-generated ﬁeld and a reversed axial-guide ﬁeld in the tapered helical wiggler. The divergence of electron beam is caused by three-dimensional effects on the electron beam loss, we employ a tapered and reversed axialguide ﬁeld magnetic ﬁeld. Evolution of energy spread and emittance of electron beam are investigated using three dimensional simulation. Beam cross-section, transverse momentum variation and cross-section view of electron beam are also calculated along z axis. The electron beam loss is reduced by optimizing the magnetic ﬁeld strength and tapering parameter of reversed axial guide ﬁeld.

INTRODUCTION
In free-electron laser(FEL), the gain increases when the beam current and the wiggler ﬁeld amplitude are increased. When the free-electron laser experiments operate at the high-current regime and the intense wiggler ﬁeld regime to get the sufﬁciently large gain, the axial-guide ﬁeld make us to steer the electron beam in the axial direction [1–4] and the electron motion can be altered by the axial-guide ﬁeld and self-ﬁeld effects [5–11] .
In this work, we study the behaviour of electron beam in combined a self-generated ﬁeld and a reversed axial-guide ﬁeld in the tapered helical wiggler. Cross-section, proﬁle and density of electron beam are investigated using three dimensional simulation.

THE SELF-GENERATED FIELD AND EXTERNAL FIELD

The space charge and current of electron beam generate the self-electric and self-magnetic ﬁelds. The Maxwell’s equations in steady state are

We assume that equilibrium properties (electron density
and velocity) are uniform in the z-direction with ∂nb/∂z = 0 and ∂vb/∂z = 0. There is no equilibrium electric ﬁeld parallel to z-direction with E · ˆez = 0. Where nb is electron density and vb is mean velocity of electron. The radial
density and velocity proﬁles are assumed to be azimuthally

symmetric about the z-axis. Therefore the density and velocity proﬁles can be written as only function of r, that is,

nb(r, θ, z) = nb(r), vb(r, θ, z) = vb,θ(r)eˆθ + vb,z(r)eˆz
The self-generated electric ﬁeld Er(r) induced by the space charge, azimuthal self-magnetic ﬁeld induced by the axial current Jz(r), and axial self-magnetic ﬁeld induced by the azimuthal current Jθ(r). One can ﬁnd the self-generated ﬁeld from the steady state Maxwell equations.
Within above assumptions, the equilibrium selfgenerated ﬁeld components are

E(r, θ, z) = Er(r)eˆr Bs(r, θ, z) = Bθ(r)eˆθ + Bz(r)eˆz

(2)

Therefore the self-generated ﬁelds are determined from the steady-state Maxwell’s equations

nian of Eq. 10.
We make the incident electron beam using the beam parameters such as electron beam energy Eb = 3 MeV, energy spread Es = 5 %, emittance x,y = 10 πmm · mrad. Fig. 1(a) shows the cross section view of the incident elec-
tron beam which is the initial state of the Gaussian ran-
dom distribution. Fig. 1(b) shows the cross section views at the exit of the wiggler for self-ﬁeld parameters κs = 2 without axial guide ﬁeld, and (c) with uniform axial guide ﬁeld ag = −2 for aw = 3. Those parameters correspond to the wiggler magnetic ﬁeld strength Bw = 2.67 kG, the guide magnetic ﬁeld strength Bw = 1.78 kG and the electron beam current Ib = 368 A for wiggler period λw = 12 cm and electron beam radius rb = 0.4 cm.

Fig. 4 shows the cross section view, transverse momentum variation and x versus x phase space for κs = 2, ag = −2 and = 0.6. The number of electron in rb along z-axis of the wiggler for various tapering parameters is shown in Fig. 5. The electron densities versus kwr are shown in Fig. 6. The electron density with tapered and reversed axial guide ﬁeld is increased by about twice correspond to that of without axial guide ﬁeld case in center of electron beam.
CONCLUSION
We studied behaviour of electron beam in combined a self-generated ﬁeld and a reversed axial-guide ﬁeld in the helical wiggler. Evolution of energy spread and emittance of electron beam were investigated by using three dimensional simulation. Beam cross-section, transverse momentum variation and cross-section view of electron beam were also calculated along z axis. The electron beam loss was reduced by optimizing the magnetic ﬁeld strength and tapering parameter of reversed axial guide ﬁeld.
