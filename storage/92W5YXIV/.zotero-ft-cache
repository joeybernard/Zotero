In this tutorial and review paper, we investigate the influence of trapped particles on the propagation of ion acoustic solitons and the role of trapped waves on the propagation of Langmuir solitons. The classical potential method allows us to construct finite amplitude soliton solutions, and trapping phenomena are found to retard the motion of solitons. Thus, ion acoustic solitons have minimum speed when they are based on an isothermal electron equation of state since this corresponds to “maximum electron trapping”. In the small amplitude regime, deviations from the Boltzmann law lead to a new nonlinear term. Subsequently, the dynamics of the soliton is governed by a modified KdVequation [e.g., (23)]. For Langmuir solitons an existence diagram is found and exhibits the comparison between experimentally observed localized structures and theory. The connection with the various small amplitude soliton solutions is also pointed out. Moreover, the inclusion of a pump and of dissipative terms in the coupled nonlinear Schrodinger-ion equation gives rise t o a

pletely is a broader range of applicability, when compared with experimental and numerical measurements. A fully nonlinear theory also provides a standard for checking approximations, made in a more involved analysis.
This article is, therefore, devoted mainly to stationary solitons and the study of trapping effects related with them. This includes particle trapping in ion acoustic solitons (Section 2) and field trapping in Langmuir solitons (Section 3) as well. Comparisons with experiments are made and possible applications are discussed. Deviating from the main line, we also study a more transient phenomenon called soliton flash because of its practical importance in laser fusion, and mention numerical schemes to solve nonlinear wave equations (Section 4).

From the above we see that the solution is of soliton-type, provided the expressions in the square brackets are negative. To be more specific we now construct appropriate electron pressure laws and densities.
Since the temporal change of the plasma quantities during the passage of the wave occurs on the ion plasma period w i t , the electron quantities being affected on the shorter wiA-timescale, can be considered as quasi-stationary.

(In laminar or weakly turbulent shockwaves where the number of retleited ions (precursor ions) is small, the moving shock-front is usually described by one half of a soliton solution [18] .}
On the other hand. the solitons generated by Ikezi and collaborators find an explanation within the usual soliton theory. e.g.. as mentioned in [19]. the deviation of the Mach-number and soliton width from the isothermal, cold ion prediction (21a. b) found by Ikezi [20] is probably an effect of the finite ion temperature.

Nonlinear wave equations which possess exact solutions are good candidates to check various kinds of numerical algorithms. The KdVequation and the Burgers equation which admit soliton

The work of Arakawa [ 5 11 demonstrates that finite difference schemes could be valuable, provided nonlinear equations are written in a conservative form. Several attempts were made to reduce phase errors which originate from the discretization of space derivatives [52-601. These phase errors can be minimized
