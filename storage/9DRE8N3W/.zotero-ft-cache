abstract
The objective of this paper is to show that anisotropic meshes with highly stretched elements can be used to compute high Reynolds number ﬂows. In particular, it will be shown that boundary layers, ﬂow detachments and all vortices are well captured automatically by the mesh. We present an anisotropic meshing based on a posteriori estimation for the incompressible Navier Stokes equations. The proposed a posteriori estimate is based on the length distribution tensor approach and the associated edge based error analysis. The Finite Element ﬂow solver is based on a Variational MultiScale (VMS) method, which consists in here of decomposing both the velocity and the pressure ﬁelds into coarse/ resolved and ﬁne/unresolved scales. This choice of decomposition is shown to be efﬁcient for simulating ﬂows at high Reynolds number. The stabilization parameters are determined taking into account the anisotropy of the mesh using a directional element diameter. The adaptation algorithm is applied to high Reynolds number ﬂows inside the 2D and 3D liddriven cavities and compared to accurate reference solutions.

1. Introduction
Anisotropic mesh adaptation has proved to be a powerful strategy to improve the quality and efﬁciency of ﬁnite element/ volume methods. It enables to capture scale heterogeneities that can appear in numerous physical or mechanical applications including those having boundary layers, shock waves, edge singularities and moving interfaces [1–5]. In these cases, discontinuities or gradients of the solution are highly directional and can be captured with a good accuracy using an anisotropic mesh with few additional elements.
Several approaches to build unstructured anisotropic adaptive meshes easily are often based on local modiﬁcations [6–9] of an existing mesh. In fact, it mainly requires extending the way to measure lengths following the space directions and that can be done using a metric ﬁeld to redeﬁne the geometric distances. In parallel, theories of anisotropic a posteriori error estimation (i.e. [10]) have been well developed, leading to some standardization of the adaptation process; production of metrics from the error analysis of the discretization error and steering of remeshing by these metrics.
It follows that most adaptive anisotropic meshing techniques take a metric map as input. In practice, it is preferable to have a nodal metric map. Indeed, during the remeshing operations, the elements are much more volatile than the mesh nodes and therefore deﬁning ﬁelds on a continuous basis ease their reconstruction, interpolation or extrapolation.
The author in [1] has adopted a different route for the metric construction. The latter is done directly at the node of the mesh without any direct information from the element, neither considering any underlying interpolation. It is performed by introducing a statistical concept: the length distribution function. A second order tensor was introduced to approximate the

distribution of lengths deﬁned by gathering the edges at the node. Using such a technique, he computed the error along each edge and in the direction of each edge.
In this work, we pursue further the approach developed in [1] in the sense that we extend this theory to take into account multi-component ﬁelds (tensors, vectors, scalars). Rather than considering several metric intersections and thus having much computation to perform, we propose herein an easy way to account for different ﬁelds in an a posteriori analysis while producing a single metric ﬁeld. We will show that the proposed approach seems to be a powerful tool for approximating the solution of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations as it accounts for all components of the velocity ﬁeld. It is based on controlling the interpolation error of the velocity ﬁeld as well as the velocity norm. Note that the proposed algorithm is implemented in the context of adaptive meshing under the constraint of a ﬁxed number of nodes. With such an advantage, we can avoid evaluating precisely the constant arising in the error analysis and provide a very useful tool for practical Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) applications.
The leading idea of this work is to show that by applying the proposed anisotropic meshing to the recently developed ﬂow solver [11], based on a Variational MultiScale (VMS) method, we are able to produce very good accuracy properties for high Reynolds number ﬂows. Precisely, on meshes with highly stretched elements we use an appropriate deﬁnition of the stabilization parameters using the directional element diameter.
For that purpose, we will address exhaustively the well known driven cavity benchmark in 2D and 3D. We demonstrate that using the proposed error estimate, all small vortices, ﬂow detachments and boundary layers inside the cavity are captured successfully.
The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the node based metric framework and describe the anisotropic mesh adaptation procedure governed by the length distribution tensor. In Section 3, the interpolation edge error for multi-component ﬁelds is described. Section 4 presents the developed VMS Navier–Stokes solver. Section 5 provides some numerical results and examples showing the capability of the new highly parallelized anisotropic mesh adaptation.

2. Edge based error estimation

In [1], we have derived an a posteriori error estimate based on the length distribution tensor approach and the associated

edge based error analysis. In particular, we have derived the node based metric framework and described the anisotropic

mesh adaptation procedure under the constraint of a ﬁxed number of nodes. In this section, we only recall those results,

but we invite the interested reader to check [1] for a detailed description and proofs. Let us recall some useful notations

and deﬁnitions.

We consider u 2 C2ðXÞ ¼ V and Vh a standard P1 ﬁnite element approximation space:

n

o

Vh ¼ wh 2 C0ðXÞ; whjK 2 P1ðKÞ; K 2 K

S

where X ¼ K; K is a simplex (segment, triangle, tetrahedron, . . . ) and K is the set of elements of the mesh.

K2K

n

o

Denote by X ¼ Xi 2 Rd; i ¼ 1; Á Á Á ; N the set of nodes of the mesh.

We also denote the Lagrange interpolation operator from V to Vh by:

Ph :V # Vh u # Phu

such that

PhuðXiÞ ¼ uðXiÞ ¼ Ui; 8i ¼ 1; Á Á Á ; N
with Ui beinng the node value of u at the mesho node location. We deﬁne the set of nodes connected to node i as shown in Fig. 1 by: CðiÞ ¼ j; 9iK 2 K; Xi; Xj are nodes of K .
By introducing the following notation: Xij ¼ Xj À Xi and Uij ¼ Uj À Ui we have for a P1 element:

where HðuÞ ¼ rð2Þu is the associated Hessian of u. Recall that taking u 2 C2ðXÞ we obtain ru 2 C1ðXÞ (Fig. 2). Applying the interpolation operator on ru we get

PhðruÞðXiÞ ¼ ruðXiÞ ¼ gi:

where gi denotes the exact value of the gradient at node i. Such interpolation combined with (1) leads to the deﬁnition of gij ¼ gj À gi given by:

rð2ÞuXij ¼ gij

ð3Þ

Finally by projecting (3) along the edge Xij we obtain:



rð2Þu Xij Á Xij ¼ gij Á Xij

ð4Þ

Consequently, we have from (4) a deﬁnition of the projected second derivative of u in terms of only the values of the gradient at the extremities of the edge. Recall also that due to the fact that uhjK 2 P1ðKÞ and u is continuous along the edge, the gradient projection along the edge is also continuous although it is a piecewise constant vector ﬁeld.

2.1. Error along the edge

We denote the error along the edges using the following expression:

eij ¼ gij Á Xij

ð5Þ

This error sampling is the exact interpolation error along the edge and enables us to evaluate the global L1 error [1].

2.2. Gradient recovery

Eq. (5) can be evaluated only when the gradient of u is known and continuous at the nodes of the mesh. However the

author in [1] proposes a recovery gradient operator deﬁned by a local optimization problem as follows:

2.3. Error behavior due to varying the edge length

We examine now how the error behaves when we change the length of the edges. In fact the objective is to ﬁnd the opti-

mal length of all the edges of the mesh.

An interesting way of linking the error variations to the changes in edge lengths is by introducing a stretching factor s 2 R

such that

(

Xe ij ¼ sXij eij ¼ s2eij ¼ s2Gij Á Xij

ð8Þ

where ~eij and Xe ij are the target error at edge ij and its associated edge length. Eqs. (8) mean that stretching the edge by a factor s changes the error quadratically and this corresponds to an optimal behavior for the P1 elements.
On the other hand, from a meshing perspective, it is not sufﬁcient to break the edge if the error is too large or to enlarge it if it is too small. Indeed, it is necessary to take into account the neighborhood of the node so that the best averaging repre-
sentation is a metric deﬁned at each node. Such a metric construction is the key point of [1].

2.4. Metric construction from the edge distribution tensor

The error analysis developed in the previous section together with the metric construction procedure leads to the ‘‘unit

Note that Mi is still positive deﬁnite when sij – 0 8ij.

2.5. Computing the stretching coefﬁcient

We introduce gij ¼ sÀij p as being the number of created nodes as a result of reducing the edge by a factor sij. The exponent p
intends to take into account the fact that the nodes are created not only along the edge but also implicitly from the crossing of the newly emerged edges. It is linked to the space dimension (2 or 3). However, any choice of p could be correct as long as the relation between the stretching sij factor and the number of created nodes tends to 1. In practice and for anisotropic meshes, we ﬁxed p ¼ 1:5 in all the following numerical experiments which gives in general a faster and satisfactory results.
Thus, if we ﬁx the total number of edges to A, the optimal mesh will be derived using the following stretching factor deﬁnition:

3. Extension to multi-component ﬁeld

The main objective of this paper is to apply the adaptive anisotropic meshing to the Navier–Stokes equations. In that case we will adapt the mesh to the velocity ﬁelds. However the following remains valid for any number of components, i.e. it provides an extension of the way of adapting mesh to multiple criteria.
A common way to adapt a mesh to several components is to calculate the metrics corresponding to each of them and then to produce a unique metric by an operation known as the intersection of metrics.
In this work, we extend the anisotropic theory developed previously and we compute the error along the edges for a vectorial quantity. Therefore, by using an adequate scaling for all the components, we show in what follows that we can still produce only one metric.
Let us introduce u ¼ fu1; u2; Á Á Á ; ung,
V ¼ V ÂV ÂÁÁÁÂV

and

Vh ¼ Vh Â Vh Â Á Á Á Â Vh

The choice of using the above theory for each component of u turns out to be particularly handy with a view to a unique

metric construction. We can still simply use the same theory developed previously without any necessary modiﬁcation. It

comes out immediately that the error is now a vector given by the following expression:

n

o

eij ¼ e1ij; e2ij; Á Á Á ; enij

Although there are other possibilities, we choose to produce a simple error value for each edge using the following:

a unique following

eij value, the scalar theory exposed in the previous sections numerical experiments, we used the L2 case to compute the

remains valid error. Indeed,

for the velocity component we did not observe a signiﬁcant difference between the two norms. However, in multiphysics

application, the choice of the norms would affect the results and this requires furthur investigations.

Navier–Stokes at high Reynolds number exhibits the emergence of vortices of different sizes. In this work, we validate the

proposed approach by comparing two and three dimensional results with very precise references on the well established lid

driven cavity problem. The objective is then to adapt the mesh not only using the velocity norm, but also all the vector

components.
Denote by vh the ﬁnite element solution of the Navier–Stokes equations. In order to build a metric ﬁeld and to construct
then the corresponding mesh, we propose to use a normalised velocity and the proposed edge-based framework. However,

in this work, we highlight the capability toaccount at the same time for the velocity and its components. Therefore, we con-

sider the following nodal vector ﬁeld uh ¼

The edge-based metric technique as the Hessian-based metric one rely then on an interpolation error of a certain u for which uh

Note that adaptivity will account for both the change of direction of the velocity (as shown in Fig. 3) and and its magnitude. Consequently, and as presented by the numerical results in the following section, even the small vortices developed by the solution will be very well captured. What is even more interesting is the capability of the method to automatically detect the boundary layers due to the anisotropically adapted mesh exhibiting highly stretched elements.
Finally, we recall that the used mesh technique referred as MTC is based on local modiﬁcations and on conformity controls through a minimal volume theorem. More details can be found in [6,5].

4. VMS: incompressible Navier–Stokes solver

In this section the general equations of time-dependent incompressible Navier–Stokes equation are solved. The stabilizing schemes from a variational multiscale point of view are revisited, described and presented [11]. Both the velocity and the pressure spaces are enriched which cures the spurious oscillations in the convection-dominated regime and deals with the pressure instability. The stabilization parameters will be determined rigorously taking into account the anisotropy of the mesh using a directional element diameter.

4.1. Basic principles of the multiscale approach

Following [12], we consider a direct sum decomposition of the velocity and the pressure ﬁelds into resolvable coarse-

scale and unresolved ﬁne-scale v ¼ vh þ v0 and p ¼ ph þ p0. Likewise, we apply the same decomposition for the weighting
functions w ¼ wh þ w0 and q ¼ qh þ q0. The unresolved ﬁne-scales are usually modelled using residual based terms that
are derived consistently. The static condensation consists of substituting the ﬁne-scale solution into the large-scale problem

providing additional terms, tuned by a local stabilizing parameter. The latter enhances the stability and accuracy of the stan-

dard Galerkin formulation.

The

Thus,

the

mixed-ﬁnite element approximation of the time-dependent Navier–Stokes problem can read:

where q and l are the density and the dynamic viscosity, respectively. To derive the stabilized formulation, we ﬁrst solve the
ﬁne scale problem, deﬁned on the sum of element interiors and written in terms of the time-dependent large-scale variables.

Then we substitute the ﬁne-scale solution back into the coarse problem, thereby eliminating the explicit appearance of the ﬁnescale while still modelling their effects. It is worth mentioning that this would be equivalent to formulating the problem with a decomposition of linears (or bilinears) plus residual-free bubbles (see [13] for more details). At this stage, two important remarks have to be made in order to deal with the time-dependency and the non-linearity of the momentum equation of the subscale system:

(i) the subscales are not tracked in time, therefore, quasi-static subscales are considered here (see [14] for a justiﬁcation

of this choice); however, the subscale equation remains quasi time-dependent since it is driven by the large-scale

time-dependent residual. For time-tracking of subscales, see [15].

(ii) the convective velocity of the non-linear term may be approximated using only large-scale part so that

Substituting the approximated v0 and p0 into the large-scale equation and applying integration by parts we get:

When compared with the standard Galerkin method, the proposed stable formulation involves additional integrals that
are evaluated element-wise. These additional terms, obtained by replacing the approximated v0 and p0 into the large-scale
equation, represent the effects of the sub-grid scales and they are introduced in a consistent way to the Galerkin formulation. All of these terms are multiplied by stabilizing parameters and enable to overcome the instability of the classical formulation arising in convection dominated ﬂows and to deal with the pressure instabilities.

where c1 and c2 are two constants independent from hK [17] and hK being the characteristic length of the element. Note that the calculation of hK is one of the main subjects of this paper. Recall that the stability coefﬁcients weight the
extra terms added to the weak formulation (11) and they are deﬁned for each element K of the triangulation (13). Typically, these coefﬁcients depend on the local mesh size hK . Many numerical experiments show that good results can be obtained when using the minimum edge length of K [18], while others always use the triangle diameter (see [19] for details).
Nevertheless, in the case of strongly anisotropic meshes with highly stretched elements, the deﬁnition of hK is still an open problem and plays a critical role in the design of the stabilizing coefﬁcients [20,17]. In [21] the authors examine deeply the effect of different element lenght deﬁnitions on disorted meshes. In [22] anisotropic error estimates for the residual free bubble (RFB) method are developed to derive a new choice of the stabilizing parameters suitable for anisotropic partitions. In this work, we adopted the deﬁnition proposed in [16] to compute hK as the diameter of K in the direction of the velocity u (see Fig. 4):

where NK is the number of vertices of K and u1; . . . ; uNK are the usual basis functions of P1ðKÞ mapped onto K.
Note also that the use of the time step in the deﬁnition of the stabilizing parameter (13) is another important issue, in particular for small time steps. Several approaches can be found in the literature, in particular the use of dynamic subscales in [15] and the deﬁnition of the stabilization parameters computed from element matrices and vectors in [16]. These approaches have been used successfully and in both cases, the steady solution is independent of the time step and are stable for small time steps. In the following section, we show that we did not encounter these problems in the numerical results. Using adaptive mesh reﬁnement, the ﬁrst term in the deﬁnition of the stabilizing parameter (13) becomes small compared to the other terms. We also varied the time steps dynamically (dynamic adaptive meshing) to ensure that the stationary solution is stable and thus the contribution of the time steps in the stabilization parameter become negligible. However, the details of the stabilizing parameters are still very important and critical for successful use of stabilizing methods. Therefore, further research will focus on upgrading the existing code to take into account dynamic subscales from one hand and adaptive time stepping on the other hand in order to address mainly non stationary problem and turbulent ﬂows.

5. Numerical examples
The performance of the method will be assessed by benchmarking the driven cavity at low and high Reynolds numbers and by comparing to very accurate reference solutions. In such simulations we show that boundary layers as well as vortices can be well captured by the mesh. Results are compared with the literature and show that the ﬂow solvers based on stabilized ﬁnite element method are able to exhibit very good accuracy properties on anisotropic meshes with highly stretched elements. Additionally, we provide new measurements positioned near boundary layers as shown in Fig. 5. Such a new set of

data can serve as a useful benchmark for comparisons of the results of the time dependent two and three dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with anisotropic mesh adaptation.
5.1. Driven ﬂow cavity problem (2-D)
We begin to numerically solve the classical 2-D lid-driven ﬂow problem. This test has been widely used as a benchmark for numerical methods and has been analyzed by a number of authors: [23,24] using ﬁnite difference and ﬁnite volume methods, and [25,26,11] using stabilized ﬁnite element method.
Homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocity are imposed equal to one on the upper boundary of the computational domain, i.e. at y ¼ 1, and zero elsewhere on. The source term is identical to zero. The time step is ﬁxed to 0:05. The density is set to one and the viscosity is adjusted in order to obtain Reynolds number of 1000, 5000, 10,000, 20,000, and 100,000.
An important point to mention before we start is that the following mesh adaptations are always performed for a ﬁxed number of nodes. This turns out to be an important advantage because it avoids a drastic increase in the number of unknowns and in the computational cost. In other words, it provides a very useful tool in particular for industrial applications. Therefore, for Reynolds number of 1000; 5000 and 10,000 we ﬁxed the number of nodes A to be equal to 10,000. The adaptive process always starts from the uniform mesh presented in Fig. 5 and is iterated every ﬁve time step.

Fig. 14. 3D Anisotropic meshes at Reynolds 1000; 3200 and 5000.
The results on the three respective converged meshes ($10,000 nodes) can be seen in Fig. 6. The exact number of nodes is 9771. Note the concentration of the resolution not only along all the boundary layers but also at the detachment regions. This reﬂects well the anisotropy of the solution caused by the discontinuity of the boundary conditions and the nature of the ﬂow. The elements at the central bulk of the cavity region around the primary vortex are mostly isotropic and increase in size as the Reynolds number increases. Again, this reﬂects and explains how, for a controlled number of nodes, the mesh is naturally and automatically coarsened in that region with the goal of reducing the mesh size around the secondary vortices in the bottom corners.
As Reynolds increases, the capturing of different secondary vortices is very good. This is mainly due to the choice of the unit vector combining the velocity components and its norm. The proposed approach shows that it is capable of capturing all the vortices at all scales. Indeed, the small voricies are not intense enough to be captured accurately by classical adaptive strategies.
The zoom on the right side of the cavity in Fig. 7 highlights how sharply the layers can be captured. It shows the correct orientation and deformation of the mesh elements (longest edges parallel to the boundary). This yields a great reduction of the number of triangles. These results give conﬁdence that the extension of the approach to take into account all the velocity components seems to work very well and plays an important role for transient ﬂows.
The objective of these simulations is to compare now the newly obtained results to very accurate reference solutions. Therefore, we ﬁrst plot the velocity proﬁles for Vx along x ¼ 0:5 and for Vy along y ¼ 0:5 at Reynolds 1000; 5000 and 10,000. Fig. 8 shows respectively that all the results are in very good agreement with a reference solution computed on a 600 Â 600 = 360,000 points ﬁxed mesh [11].
For more comparisons, we present in Table 1 and 2 values of the vertical and horizontal components of the velocity along x ¼ 0:5 and y ¼ 0:5, respectively. We report our results taken out from simulations made ﬁrst on a ﬁne isotropic mesh (600Â600) and second from the converged anisotropic meshes ($10,000 nodes). We compare these results to very precise computations found in [27,28] made on a uniform grid composed of 5000Â5000 nodes. As shown in Table 1 and 2, a very good agreement is pointed between the present solution on isotropic 600Â600 unstructured meshes and the references. The agreement is very good up to the fourth digit. However, also results from the anisotropic meshes compare well and agree up to the second digit with the highly accurate solutions computed on 5000 Â 5000 = 25,000,000 points [28]. Again, results obtained by the VMS ﬂow solver using either isotropic or, and in particular, anisotropic meshes compete very well to the literature.
It is worth to mention that there is a lack in the literature of highly resolved data at high Reynolds number. In particular, measurements taken near the walls does not exist yet in the literature. Thus, it makes the comparisons and validation of the code on anisotropic meshes at high Reynolds number difﬁcult. Therefore, we will use in what follows our results carried out on the isotropic meshes (600Â600) as references.
The newly introduced additional sensors near boundary layers are presented in Table 2. These sensors placed close to the walls are crucial for validating the efﬁciency in well capturing the boundary layers. Furthermore, we present the new plots taken near the corners in Figs. 9–11. We preview that the rich set of data presented herein could constitute a very interesting benchmark for purposes of validating the accuracy of the adaptive anisotropic meshing for incompressible Navier–Stokes near boundary layers.
We show in these ﬁgures the velocity proﬁles for Vy along y ¼ 0:1; 0:05; 0:9 and 0:99 and for Vx along x ¼ 0:1 and 0:9 at Reynolds 1000; 5000 and 10,000. All the results are in very good agreement with the proposed reference having 600Â600 elements. It is clear that in regions of intense vortices and very close to the walls, the use of anisotropic meshes plays a critical role. All the boundary layers are sharply captured and automatically identiﬁed. We can clearly see from these plots that the creation of extremely stretched elements near the walls provides accurate results. The reference computed on a very ﬁne

isotropic mesh (600Â600) agree with the anisotropic results using only 10,000 nodes up to the second digit and differ very slightly in the third digit at some points. We provide in Tables 3–9 in the Appendix the evaluation of all the velocity proﬁles at different benchmark locations and for different Reynolds number. Such a new set of data can serve as a useful benchmark for comparisons of the results.
Finally, in order to assess the capability of the VMS method to simulate high Reynolds number ﬂows on anisotropic meshes, we repeated the simulation for Reynolds numbers of 20,000 and 100,000. Note that details on obtaining the steady solution for different Reynolds numbers is analyzed by the authors in [11] and will not be repeated here.
We increased the number of nodes to 20,000 in order to capture more accurately the characteristic of the unsteady solution. We present only in Fig. 12 snapshots of the meshes at a certain time step. As expected, all the main directional features characterizing the velocity inside the lid-driven cavity are detected and well captured by the anisotropic error estimator. The mesh elements are highly stretched along the direction of the layers, at the detachments regions and around all the newly appeared secondary vortices. Once again, the developed incompressible Navier–Stokes VMS solver shows to be very efﬁcient and robust at high Reynolds numbers using highly stretched elements. Again, for a given constraint on the number of elements we can ﬁnd the mesh that maximizes the accuracy of the numerical solution.
5.2. Driven ﬂow cavity problem (3-D)
We continue to numerically solve the classical 3-D lid-driven ﬂow problem. Same as in the 2-D case, Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed on the velocity. At the upper wall at z ¼ 1 it is equal to one, and zero elsewhere. The source term is

identical to zero. The time step is ﬁxed to 0:05 s. The viscosity is adjusted in order to obtain Reynolds number of 1000; 3200 and 5000.
All numerical experiments are done with a ﬁxed number of elements ($450,000). Again, in 3-D where the ﬂow characteristics are much more complicated, all the boundary layers as well as the vortices are sharply captured and identiﬁed.
Fig. 13 highlights the stretching of the elements near the walls, in the corners and even at the buriﬁcations of the vortices for Reynolds equal 1000; 3200 and 5000 respectively. The higher the Reynolds number is, the denser the mesh around these regions is as shown in Fig. 14. The velocity proﬁles for Vy along y ¼ 0:5 and for Vx along x ¼ 0:5 at Reynolds 1000 and 3200 are presented in Fig. 15. All the results are in good agreement with the reference having a twice ﬁner mesh of 96Â96Â96 grid points [29].
In Fig. 16 we present different zoomed captures on the mesh to show how the elements can be highly stretched along the direction of the layers. This reﬂects well the accuracy and details of the resolution caused by the discontinuity of the boundary conditions and the nature of the ﬂow.
The anisotropic adaptive procedure modiﬁes the mesh in a way that the local mesh resolutions become adequate in all directions. Recall again that these plots reﬂect for the given ﬁxed number of elements ($450,000) the mesh that maximizes the accuracy of the numerical solution. More analysis taking into account an increased number of elements and higher Reynolds number will be the subject of further investigations. The presented test cases are considered here in the objective of demonstrating the capability of the VMS method to simulate 2D and 3D high Reynolds number ﬂows on anisotropic meshes.
6. Conclusions
We have showed in this paper that anisotropic adapted meshes with highly stretched elements can be used to compute high Reynolds number ﬂows. We presented an a posteriori estimate based on the length distribution tensor approach and the associated edge based error analysis. We proposed an important extension of the anisotropic theory for computing the error along the edges for a vectorial quantity. It was addressed for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. All the meshes are obtained under the constraint of a ﬁxed number of edges in the mesh. The Variational MultiScale (VMS) method is shown to be efﬁcient for simulating ﬂows at high Reynolds number. We demonstrated the efﬁciency of the anisotropic adaptive procedure to be capable of automatically producing boundary layer meshes inside the 2D and 3D lid-driven cavities. The numerical results show that the ﬂow solvers based on stabilized ﬁnite element method is able to exhibit good stability and accuracy properties on anisotropic meshes. All the main directional features characterizing the velocity inside the cavities are detected and well captured by the anisotropic error estimator. The mesh elements are highly stretched along the direction of the layers, at the detachments regions and around all the vortices. Further investigations will take into account the performance of the presented adaptive method in terms of the computational cost, the speed-up and the frequency of remeshing.
