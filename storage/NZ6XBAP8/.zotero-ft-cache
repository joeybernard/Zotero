We perform a global sensitivity analysis of the binding energy and the charge radius of the nucleus 16O to identify the most influential low-energy constants in the next-to-next-to-leading order chiral Hamiltonian with two- and three-nucleon forces. For this purpose, we develop a subspace-projected coupled-cluster method using eigenvector continuation [Frame D. et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 032501 (2018)]. With this method, we compute the binding energy and charge radius of 16O at more than 106 different values of the 16 low-energy constants in one hour on a standard laptop computer. For relatively small subspace projections, the root-mean-square error is about 1% compared to full-space coupled-cluster results. We find that 58(1)% of the variance in energy can be apportioned to a single contact term in the 3S1 wave, whereas the radius depends sensitively on several low-energy constants and their higher-order correlations. The results identify the most important parameters for describing nuclear saturation and help prioritize efforts for uncertainty reduction of theoretical predictions. The achieved acceleration opens up an array of computational statistics analyses of the underlying description of the strong nuclear interaction in nuclei across the Segre` chart.

Introduction.—How do properties of atomic nuclei depend on the underlying interaction between protons and neutrons? Recent ab initio computations of nuclei [1–16] have revealed that observables such as binding energies, radii, spectra, and decay probabilities are very sensitive to the values of the low-energy constants (LECs) in chiral Hamiltonian models with two- and three-nucleon forces [17–19]. Certain interaction models work better than others, but only for selected types of observables and in limited regions of the Segre` chart. It is not clear why. The NNLOsat interaction [20] reproduces experimental binding energies and charge radii for nuclei up to mass A ∼ 50 [4,5,9,16], while the 1.8=2.0 (EM) interaction [21,22] reproduces binding energies and low-lying energy spectra up to mass A ∼ 100 [4,7,8,10,12,15], and while the radii are underestimated.
To improve theoretical predictions requires rigorous uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analyses that are grounded in the description of the underlying nuclear Hamiltonian. Unfortunately, the number of model samples required for statistical computing increases exponentially with the number of uncertain LECs. A global sensitivity analysis of the ground-state energy and charge radius 16O, based on a realistic next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) chiral Hamiltonian with 16 LECs, requires more than 106 model evaluations. Similar numbers can be expected for a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling of Bayesian marginalization end evidence integrals [23–25]. Clearly, this is not

feasible given the computational cost of existing state-of-

the-art ab initio many-body methods applied to medium-

mass and heavy nuclei.

In this Letter, we solve this problem by utilizing

eigenvector continuation [26] to develop a subspace-pro-

jected coupled-cluster (SPCC) method as a fast and

accurate approximation to the corresponding full-space

CC method [27–33]. The SPCC method generalizes the

eigenvector-continuation formalism in Ref. [34] to non-

Hermitian problems and enables accelerated computation

of nuclear observables across the Segre` chart for any target

value α⃗ ⊚ of the LECs in the underlying Hamiltonian. See Fig. 1 for a demonstration of the SPCC method applied to

16O and the variation of a single LEC (details are given

below). We will use SPCC to analyze the description of the

16O ground-state energy and charge radius across a large

domain of relevant LECs. This way we can for the first time

clearly identify the LECs that have the biggest impact on

binding energy and radius predictions, which in turn

impacts saturation properties of nuclear matter [8,35,36].

Method.—Following Ref. [34], we start by representing

the chiral Hamiltonian at NNLO Hðα⃗ Þ as a linear combi-

exchange, and terms proportional to the pion and nucleon
masses. The analytical form of the NNLO Hamiltonian is
identical to the one of NNLOsat [20], including the regularization scheme, which means that, for a particular value α⃗ ¼ α⃗ ⋆, the Hamiltonian Hðα⃗ ⋆Þ will reproduce the binding energy and radius predictions of NNLOsat. The SPCC Hamiltonian for a target value α⃗ ¼ α⃗ ⊚ is constructed by projecting Hðα⃗ ⊚Þ onto the subspace spanned by CC wave functions obtained at Nsub different values for α⃗ . SPCC is a controlled approximation to the full-space CC
method, and it allows for rapid and accurate solutions to the
many-nucleon problem necessary for statistical computing.
In this Letter, we use the CC method in the singles and
doubles (CCSD) approximation.
The workhorse of the CC method is the similarity transformed Hamiltonian H¯ ðα⃗ Þ ¼ e−Tðα⃗ ÞHðα⃗ ÞeTðα⃗ Þ, where
in the CCSD approximation the cluster operator is truncated at one-particle–one-hole and two-particle–two-hole excitations, i.e., Tðα⃗ Þ ¼ T1ðα⃗ Þ þ T2ðα⃗ Þ. For clarity, we have indicated the implicit dependence on α⃗ . The CCSD similarity transformation is nonunitary and renders H¯ ðα⃗ Þ
non-Hermitian, and we thus introduce Nsub biorthogonal left and right CC ground states,

hΨ˜ j ¼ hΦ0j½1 þ Λðα⃗ Þe−Tðα⃗ Þ;

jΨi ¼ eTðα⃗ ÞjΦ0i: ð1Þ

Here Λðα⃗ Þ ¼ Λ1ðα⃗ Þ þ Λ2ðα⃗ Þ is a linear expansion in oneparticle–one-hole and two-particle–two-hole deexcitation
operators, and we have biorthonormality according to hΨ˜ jΨi ¼ 1. For notational simplicity, we will from here on omit the explicit α⃗ dependence in the (de)excitation operators and set Tðα⃗ Þ ¼ T and Λðα⃗ Þ ¼ Λ, respectively. The reference state jΦ0i is built from harmonic oscillator single-particle states, and we solve the CCSD equations in a
model space comprising 11 major oscillator shells with a frequency ℏΩ ¼ 16 MeV. The matrix elements of the
three-nucleon interaction that enters the Hamiltonian are truncated by the energy cut E3 max ≤ 14. The CCSD result for 16O with NNLOsat in this model space is −118.76 MeV, which is within 1 MeV of the converged CCSD value using
a Hartree-Fock basis.
Using the Nsub different CCSD ground-state vectors in Eq. (1), the matrix elements of the target Hamiltonian in the
subspace and the corresponding norm matrix are given by

hΨ˜ 0jHðα⃗ ⊚ÞjΨi ¼ hΦ0jð1 þ Λ0Þe−T0 Hðα⃗ ⊚ÞeTjΦ0i

¼ hΦ0jð1 þ Λ0ÞeXH¯ ðα⃗ ⊚ÞjΦ0i;

ð2Þ

hΨ˜ 0jΨi ¼ hΦ0jð1 þ Λ0ÞeXjΦ0i;

ð3Þ

respectively. Here we also introduced eX ¼ e−T0þT, and H¯ ðα⃗ ⊚Þ is the similarity transformed target Hamiltonian. The left ground state hΨ˜ 0j ¼ hΦ0jð1 þ Λ0Þe−T0 is obtained from Hðα⃗ 0Þ, and the right ground state eTjΦ0i is obtained from Hðα⃗ Þ. We can now solve the generalized non-
Hermitian Nsub × Nsub eigenvalue problem for the SPCC target Hamiltonian to obtain the ground-state energy and
wave function in the subspace. With the SPCC wave
function, we can also calculate the expectation value of
any subspace-projected operator with matrix elements hΨ˜ 0jOjΨi. Equations (2) and (3) can be evaluated using Wick’s theorem, and closed form algebraic expressions are
given in the Supplemental Material [37]. Note that in
general the reference states for the Nsub different subspace CC wave functions in Eq. (1) are nonorthogonal. This is a nontrivial case and would require the generalized Wick’s
theorem [38,39] in order to evaluate the matrix elements of
the SPCC Hamiltonian and the norm matrix. Results.—The SPCC predictions for the energy and
charge radius in 16O as a function of the LEC C1S0 in the Hamiltonian are shown in Fig. 1. Using Nsub ¼ 5 exact CCSD ground-state vectors, from a small region of C1S0 values, points 1–5 in Fig. 1, the SPCC method extrapolates
to the exact CCSD results across a large C1S0 range. With Nsub ¼ 3 CCSD vectors, points 1–3 in Fig. 1, the radius extrapolation deteriorates far away from the exact solu-
tions, while the energy predictions remain more accurate.
We now move to the challenging case where all 16 LECs
at NNLO can vary. In the following, we analyze two SPCC Hamiltonians based on Nsub ¼ 64 and Nsub ¼ 128 CCSD

ground-state vectors, referred to as SPCC(64) and SPCC(128), respectively. The ground-state vectors are obtained at Nsub points in a domain of LEC values that surrounds the nominal LEC values of NNLOsat within Æ20% relative variation. This domain spans a rather large interval of ground-state energies and charge radii in 16O. The three-nucleon contact LEC cE ≈ 0.0395 in NNLOsat is small compared to the values of the remaining 15 LECs; we therefore scaled cE with a factor of 20. In accordance with observation, we also constrained the leading-order isospinbreaking 1S0 LECs (C˜ ) to exhibit small isospin breaking. We draw Nsub values for α⃗ using a space-filling Latin hypercube design and solve for the exact CCSD wave function at each point. We have verified that the SPCC(64) and SPCC(128) Hamiltonians reproduce the energies and radii of the exact CCSD calculations for all Nsub choices of α⃗ .
Figure 2 shows the cross validation with respect to an additional set of 200 randomly drawn exact CCSD calculations in the same 20% domain. From the cross validation, we extract a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of SPCC(64): 4 MeV and 0.04 fm for the ground-state energy and charge radius, respectively. With SPCC(128), the RMSE values are 3 MeV and 0.02 fm. Using more subspace vectors gives better predictions. The present results are within the expected accuracy of CCSD. The nonhermiticity of the CCSD equations yields SPCC Hamiltonians that do not obey a variational bound with respect to the exact CCSD calculations. From Fig. 2, we see that this is a minute effect.
We use SPCC(64) and global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to analyze how the ab initio predictions for the energy and charge radius in 16O explicitly depend on the LECs in the NNLO nuclear interaction. GSA is a very powerful, although computationally demanding, method for learning how much each unknown model parameter contributes to the uncertainty in a model prediction [40], as opposed to an uncertainty analysis, which addresses the question of how uncertain the prediction itself is. With SPCC, we can carry out the large amount of model evaluations that is required to extract statistically significant GSA results. In the following, we treat the ground-state energy or radius of 16O as an output Y ¼ fðα⃗ Þ of a model f, given here by the SPCC(64) Hamiltonian and its eigendecomposition. In the GSA, we decompose the total variance Var½Y as

The first-order sensitivity, Si, is often referred to as the main effect. It apportions the total variance in the

The main and total effects were computed from ð16 þ 1Þ × 216 ¼ 1 114 112 quasi-MC evaluations of the SPCC(64) Hamiltonian. The vertical lines on each bar indicate bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. A larger sensitivity value implies that the corresponding

and αj. The number of higher-order indices grow exponentially with the number of parameters in the model. Fortunately, it is possible to compute the sum of all sensitivity indices for each αi, i.e., STi ¼ Si þ Sij þ Sijk þ Á Á Á. This is referred to as the total effect, and it quantifies the total sensitivity of Var½Y to parameter αi, including all of its higher-order parameter combinations [42]. We always have STi ≥ Si and equality for purely additive models. In this analysis, we do not calibrate the model to reproduce data. We study the behavior and response of the model itself, and we assume all LECs to be independent of each other and uniformly distributed. In future studies, one could draw LECs from a Bayesian posterior distribution.
Figure 3 shows the results from the GSA of the 16O energy and radius using a SPCC(64) chiral NNLO Hamiltonian. To limit the model response of the energy and radius to a physically reasonable interval, we sample a LEC domain corresponding to 10% variation around the NNLOsat values only. The LEC cE is still scaled with a factor of 20. The MC sample size required for carrying out a reliable GSA depends on (i) the complexity of the model, and (ii) the number of parameters in the model. We have to use ð16 þ 1Þ × 216 ¼ 1 114 112 quasi-MC samples to extract statistically significant main and total effects of the energy and radius for all LECs. With SPCC(64), this took about one hour on a standard laptop computer, while an equivalent set of exact CCSD computations would require 20 years. We find that 58(1)% of the variance in the energy can be attributed to the leadingorder LEC C˜ 3S1 and that all main and total effects are

nearly identical, which signals that the energy is nearly additive in all LECs. We would like to point out that C˜ 3S1 is directly proportional to the deuteron binding energy. However, to calibrate realistic nuclear interactions requires additional data, partly from heavier-mass nuclei; see, e.g., Ref. [20]. For the radius, the main effects are distributed across several LECs, and they differ from the total effects. Indeed, second-order correlations between the LECs are responsible for almost 14% of the variance in the radius. This result also reflects the challenge, and importance, of optimizing chiral NNLO Hamiltonians to reproduce radii of medium-mass atomic nuclei and, consequently, saturation properties of nuclear matter. Our analysis also reveals that the energy and radius of 16O are not sensitive to the short-range parts of the threenucleon interaction in this domain. Of the long-range πN LECs, c1;3;4, only c4 exhibits a non-negligible main effect for the energy and radius. This LEC contributes to the tensor force in the nucleon-nucleon interaction. As expected, only P-wave LECs with large spin weights contribute to the 16O wave function. There also seems to be a larger sensitivity of the radius to the isospin-breaking terms in the interaction. Constraining the πN LECs to within the limits of the recent Roy-Steiner analysis [43] does not alter the sensitivity pattern or our conclusions. The GSA results guide future uncertainty reduction efforts for specific observables by identifying noninfluential LECs, which is also useful for, e.g., calibration. The SPCC method will significantly leverage statistical computation for analyzing correlations between different observables in different nuclei across the Segre` chart.

Summary and outlook.—We have developed the SPCC method for evaluating nuclear observables at different values of the LECs in chiral Hamiltonians at unprecedented speed. With a modest number of subspace vectors, Nsub ¼ 64, we reached 1% accuracy relative to exact CCSD solutions in 16O. CC can also generate subspace vectors for heavier nuclei, and according to the theoretical underpinnings of eigenvector vector continuation, smooth changes of the wave function should mostly live in a low-dimensional manifold. Therefore, we expect the SPCC method to scale well with larger A. From a GSA, we conclude that the variance of the ground-state energy in 16O is additive in all LECs of the NNLO chiral Hamiltonian, and that the charge radius depends sensitively on the combination of several LECs. The SPCC method enables a sophisticated statistical computation [44–47] in ab initio nuclear theory to reveal which new data would best reduce the uncertainty in Hamiltonian models and for understanding how properties of atomic nuclei depend on the underlying interaction between protons and neutrons. The stability of 16O with respect to breakup into 4He clusters is a relevant example [35,48–50]. The SPCC method also enables straightforward computation of derivatives with respect to the LECs using, e.g., algorithmic differentiation. SPCC Hamiltonians occupy very little disk space, and they can easily be shared within the nuclear community. SPCC matrix elements for 16O are available from the authors
