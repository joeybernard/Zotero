Abstract. Nonlinearthree-dimensiona(l3-D) simulationsof the gradientdrift instability (GDI) arepresentedfor a two-dimensionaelquilibriumdensitygradientrepresentinga polar cap plasma patch. The overall evolution of structuring of the plasma patch is influenced markedly by the effects caused by dynamics parallel to the geomagnetic field. The !ong wavelengths(kLn•_l) are stronglystabilizedin the 3-D case,and the nonlinearstate is dominatedby smallermesoscale(skLn>>l) (where k and Ln are the mode number and densitygradientscalelength, respectively). The resultsprovidean interpretation to the observationsat the high-latitude ionosphereindicating a generation of mesoscale irregularities associatedwith the polar cap patcheswhen the interplanetary magnetic field ([MF) Bz is southwardand antisunwardconvectionprevailsoverthe polar cap. The polar cap patchesare observedto convectto largedistances(•3000 km) undergoingstructuring while maintaining their distinct identity. Thus we suggest here that the inclusion of three-dimensional effectsis key to a successfulinterpretation of high-latitude irregularities, as well as a prerequisite for a credible simulation of these processes.

1. Introduction
The ionosphericplasma at high latitudes is known to display plasma density and electric field structure whichencompasseaswiderangeof both spatial(hundredsof kilometersto metersor less) and temporal (hoursto minutes)scales[Tsunoda1, 988;Kelley, 1989;Crowley,1996](seealsothe specialsectionon coupling, energetics, and dynamics of atmospheric regionsR, adioScience2, 9(1), 155-405,1994).These irregularities have been studied using ground-based radio and optical techniques, in situ spacecraft measurements, and scintillation techniques, among others. The large or macroscales(hundredsof kilometers) are obviouslyof global origin and have been characterizedas "patches"(in the polar cap), or "blobs"(at aurorallatitudes) [Weberet al., 1984, 1986; Basu et al., 1990; Basu et al., 1994]. The mediumscales(alsoreferredto as "mesoscale")in, the range of 0.1 km to a few kilometers, may be the result o[ a local processsuch as a plasma instability.

The polar cap patches in effect very much resemble a plasma cloud, as they drift from the cusp region to the polar cap (in the antisunwarddirection at speeds•100-1000 m/s). Mesoscaleirregularitiesare observed in association with these patches throughout the polar cap region [Weber et al., 1984, 1986; Tsunoda,1988;Basu et al., 1990;Basu et al., 1994], with irregularities often being more intense on the trailing edgethan on the leadingedge[Weberet al., 1984], suggestingthat the gradientdrift instability
(GDI) is a likelygenerationmechanism. In this paper, three-dimensiona(l3-D) nonlinear
simulations are presented for the gradient drift instability (GDI). The 3-D analytical treatments in the collisionalregime for the GDI [Drake et al., 1988; Chaturvedi and Huba, 1987] show that dynamics parallel to the geomagnetic field are stabilizing at long wavelengths. We first present numerical results of the role of the parallel electric field on the linear growth rate of the nonlocal GDI for a two-dimensional density equilibrium with variation transverse to the ambient magnetic field and variation along the field. We then present a simulation of the nonlinearevolutionof the patches/blobsat late times. Numerically, a code for the nonlocal GDI, including the parallel dynamics, is developedfor an equilibrium transversedensity gradient profile more realistic than the ones hitherto considered, as well as one with a variation along the field line.

with the time-dependent code, it is also clear that
the lowest mode number in the x direction as well as
the z direction is the most unstable. This is consis-
tent with the localgrowthrate in equation(3), which
shows that the smallest values of k.•,and kz give the largestgrowthfor a givenk..qT. h•s we havedemonstrated that the inclusion of the dynamics along the field leads to significant reduction of the growth rates for the gradient drift instability in plasmas patches and as a consequencemust be included to shed light on the observedstructuring of the patches. Another important consequenceof this study is that there a nat•ral parallel electric field that developsdue to the gradient drift instability.
We now proceed to the solution of the system of
nonlinearequations(4) and (5). A fully nonlinear
three-dimensional finite difference code has been de-
veloped to solve these coupled equations. As shown in Figure 1 for a characteristic scale length of L0 of 20 kin, the size of the computation box in tim x, and y directions is 160x kin. In the z direction
we choose L•:1000 kin. We use a value of the parameter/•=200. Typically, larger values of/• would be more realistic for the bigger patches. However, d•m to available computer resources, this choice of /• is reasonable and would be valid for the smaller-
sizedpatchesT. he transversdeiffusionDñ----2x 10-3
Once again, as in the caseof the linearized systemof eq•mtions,we use the Dirichlet boundary conditions for the perturbed density and potential at x=0 and L:•;. Similarly, in the z direction we use the Neumann boundary conditions at z=0 and z=L• for the pert•rbed density and potential. We initialize the perturbed density as a superpositionof re=l-70 sine modes in the y direction with random phases. The variationin the x directionis sin(7rx/L:•)for eachof the modes. Finally, as in the linear case, we do not introduce any variations for the initial perturbations in the z direction. The amplitude of each of the harmonics is assumedto be inversely proportional to the
transverse wavenumber of the mode. The number of
grid points used in these simluations are N•--101,
Ny:260, and N•:51. The initial amplitudemulti-
plier for each of the modes was assumedto be 0.001. For this set of parameters, the normalized timescale t0=200 s for a wind velocityof 100 m/s.
In Figures 3a-3d we show the evolution of the density in the xy plane near the peak of the density profile in z, at four different instants of time, t=8, 24, 40, and 66. As in the linear case, the instability

growson the unstablesideof the densitygradient. In the early nonlinearphase(t=8), the modesdevelop. However, they are not large enough in amplitude to modify the ambient density gradient. The structuring is dominated at the short wavelengthsin the y direction. As time progresses, the modes grow to large enoughamplitude to modify the original density, and the structuring leads to the formation of very fine scaledfingerspenetrating the bulk of the density gradient. This is clearly seen at the times t=24 and 40. Finally, at t=66, the fingershave penetrated to the stable side of the density gradient. What is clearly seenis that there is a significantextention of the average density gradient on the unstable side of the original density gradient, while the original density gradient on the left side, is not that significantlymodified. This is consistentwith some of the observations[Basuet al., 1990],whichshowa strong asymmetry in the gradient scale lengths between the leading and trailing edgesof the patch. In terms of the real time this corresponds to approximately 4 hmxrs.We hasten to add that the absolute
timescale sho•xld not be taken as final since it de-
pendson the dissipation•xsedin our code. What really matters is the relative timescalefor two different values of/J. [n a second run we used/•=10. For this case the struct•xring is very similar in spatial character to the/•J--200 case. This is to be expected since in both the cases the shorter wavelengths are the fastest growing, as shown in Figure 2a. However, the structuring occurred on a much faster timescale. It reached the level of structuring shown in Figure 3d in
about one third the time. In earlier two-dimensional
simulationsby Mitchell et al. [1985],the patch had disintegratedinto smaller-sizedpatchesin lessthan an ho•r due to the severity of the instability in two dimensions. In Figures 4a-4d we display the poten-
tial (:ontours at the same instants of time as the den-
sity in Figure 3. Since the equilibrium potential is zero for the chosen2-D density equilibrium, even at t=8, the potential perturbation localized on the unstable gradient is clearly seen. With the passageof time one sees the rapid expansion of the structure along the x direction as the fingers penetrate into the bulk of the plasma patch. The rapid acceleration of the fingering process in the nonlinear phase can be understood as follows. As the perturbation develops,very steeplocalizeddensitygradientsdevelopin the fingers. Since the growth rate of the instability is inverselyproportional to the densitygradientscale length L,•, the fingeringproceedsfaster. However,we

of our simulations is the dependenceof the smallscale structure size and timescale of structuring on
the diffusion used in the code. This can be reme-
died by introducing ion inertial effects as discussed below. Another unrealistic aspectof the presentsimulations is the amplitude and asymmetry of the x and y structures of the density irregularities. Although the structuring with our 3-D model shows that the very short scales dominate, it is important to realize that the simulated elongated fingers are not consis-
tent with observations. There is no clear evidence
of such strong asymmetry in the x and y directions in the fluctuation spectrum. Also, the large levels of density fluctuations of the order of 100% are not consistent with the observations, where density flucutationsare more in the rangeof 10% (R. Heelis et al., private communication,1997). One important physics aspect that has been neglected in these
simulations is the role of the linear and the nonlinear

inertial effects. For the short wavelength modesthese are important sincethe nonlinearinertial effectscan lead to breakup of the fingers, thereby removing the strong asymmetry. Furthermore, the breakup of the fingers will invariably prevent fluctuation levels as high as those obtained in our present simulations. Also, it is quite possiblethat the breakul) scalelength rattmr than dissipation will determine the shortest scale lengths allowed. Another important consideration is the fact that as the polar cap patch moves antisunward, there is a distortion of the patch as well as a time-dependence to the flow velocity, both of which can influence the evolution of the development of the gradient drift instability and the subsequent structuring. These issueswill be the systematically
addressed in future studies.
