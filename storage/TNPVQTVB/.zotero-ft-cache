The stahility of three-dimensional planar Langmuir solitons. M. J . Wardrop and D. ter Haar (Department of Theoretical Physics, 1 Keble Road. Oxford OX1 3NP. England). Physica Scripta (Sweden) 20, 493-501,1979.
We discuss the stability of three-dimensional planar Langmuir solitons which are solutions of both the correct Zakharov equations and the simplified, curl-free equations which many authors have considered. We resolve the differences between various results obtained by different authors, show that the simplified equations used by them are unlikely to be a good approximation, and estimate the growth rates for the case of the exact equations.

and E, n, x, and t are all suitably normalized (we use the same normalization as in Gibbons et al.? [ l ] or Thornhill and ter Haar. [ 3 ] .As T , for typical plasmas ranges from l o 4 to 10’ K , (Y is always a large parameter, a fact which is of the utmost importance for the discussion in the present paper.
We shall now consider the following planar soliton solution of eq. (1) and (2):

1. Introduction

Eo = E,+ = .?ail sech A[ exp (ikox - h o t ) .

(4)

The stability of Langmuir solitons is a problem which has a certain amount of interest in connection with a possible soliton theory of strong Langmuir turbulence. In one dimension a Langmuir soliton is stable. but scaling of the energy shows that solitons in two or three dimensions are unstable (see, e.g., Gibbons et al., [ I ] ) . Consider now a plasma which is pumped by a plane, electrostatic wave. If the turbulent energy level is sufficiently high, the modulational growth rate for longitudinal perturbations is much greater than for transverse perturbations [ 2 . 31. We may therefore expect that planar Langmuir solitons will form. The question now arises as t o their stability. As one-dimensional solitons are stable, it seems likely that planar solitons in three dimensions are unstable to transverse perturbations. At that point, however, the literature becomes confused and it is the aim of the present paper t o sort it the situation.
I n the next section we write down the basic equations and discuss their perturbations. In Section 3 we discuss a special case of the basic equations which has been studied by most other authors with different and conflicting results. We resolve these differences, In the last section we consider the general equations and estimate the growth rates for that case. We show that the special case studied by other authors is unlikely t o be a p o d approximation.

There is, of course, no y - or z-dependence in expression (4). We now consider perturbations to the planar soliton of the form

We shall discuss tw3 special cases: (I) planar geometry. in which case we have

We have here considered the cylindrical geometry; the planar case (I) can be similarly handled.
If the variables are changed from x, t to t;, t and the explicit form of 6 E given in (9) is substituted, we obtain

(23)
Note that this equation determines n in terms off, only and does not involve f, or g,. In principle, this makes it possible to
have different growth rates r in the longitudinal and transverse
directions, with the time development of n being determined by
the longitudinal field growth rate.

3. The curl-free equations

Several authors have considered eqs. (1) and (2) with a = 1; they reach different and conflicting conclusions about soliton instability. Both Zakharov and Rubenchik [4] and Degtyarev,
Zakharov and Rudakov [SI have found a real value for r which
grows linearly with K for small K . Schmidt [9] has also found a
- 4;. r two-dimensional soliton to be unstable but obtains 0:
Pereira, Sudan and Denavit [6] also obtain r K and present
some interesting computer calculations. Infeld and Rowlands
[7] however, find soliton stability and claim to have found inconsistencies in previous authors’ work. In this section we resolve the differences.
Consider eqs. (16) t o (19) with a set equal t o 1:
Lf,-ansechz-K2f, = rg,, Lg,--K2gx = - r f x (24)

L g r - K z g r = -rf,, Lf,-K2f, = rg,

(25)

Equations (25) combine to give

+ + d2F,
- (2 sech’z - 1 - K’ iF)F, = 0 dz

(26)

It should be noted at this point that in deriving (26) we started
from the assumption that r in eqs. (16)-(19) was real. However,
by considering eqs. (13) and (14) and setting a = 1 directly, it
may be seen that (26) holds for complex as well as real values
of r.
Substituting 0 = tanh z transforms this equation to

Most of the published calculations have considered Langmuir collapse and are not relevant to our discussion. However, the stability of two-dimensional planar solitons has been considered by Denavit. Pereira and Sudan [16] and Pereira, Sudan and Denavit [6] any analytic results on soliton stability in two dimensions should be compared with their work. In the study
