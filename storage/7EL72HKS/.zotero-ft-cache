2 . Magneto-ionic Theory for an Electron Gas

In considering propagation at frequencies 0(' several kilohertz and hi gh er , th e mo t ion s of heavy ions may be ignored. sin ce the ion plasm a frequency and ionic gyrorreq uen cy in the earth's atmosphere are less than a few hundred hertz.
T h e field equations for a time-harmonic (e Jwl ) electromagnetic field in an electron gas can
then b e wl'itten [Oster, 1960] in linearized form for fields of small amplitude (}J.olIr,<< Bo),
and for zero average drift velocity of the electron gas,

where
E, H represent the time-varying electromagnetic field intensities, Bo is the flux density of the geomagnetic field , N is the average electron density, v is the electron velocity, averaged over a small element of volume whose radius is the Debye length, e is electronic charge, m is electron mass, v is the electron collision frequency, Po is the time-averaged pressure of the electron gas, p is the time-varying component of pressure, 'Y is the ratio of specific heats, eq ual to 5/3 for a gas of free electrons.

Equations (1) and (2) are just Maxwell's equations, taking into account convection CID'I'ents due to electron motion; (3) is the combined eq uation of contin uity and state, and (4) is the momentum equation.
Equations (3) and (4) can be combined to give

which now gives the behavior of the electron plasma, expr essed in terms of the velocity, in response to the electromagnetic forces acting upon it.
Now to solve the field equations (1), (2 ), and (5), consider propagation of a plane wave. Expressing t h e field vectors in terms of a Cartesian coordinate system, and taking the z-axis along the direction o[ propagation, it is seen that the spatial dependence of all time-varying quantities is given by e- i {3z, where {3 is the propagation constant, which may be complex.
The two Maxwell equations, (1) and (2), may be combined to give a wave equation,

3. Perturbation Solution of the Determinantal Equation
The d eterminantal (10) yields a cubi c equation in (32, with complex coeffi.cients. An analytic solution of the equation is difficult except for some sp ecial cases, wh en the direction of propagation is either along, or transverse to the direction of the geomagn etic fleld. For t h e transverse case, there are no solution s which yield Re ((3Z» O, or a propagating wave. In the longitudinal case, two such solutions occ ur. One of these values of (32 corresponds to whistler mode propagation, and the other to a longitudinal acousLic wave.
A perturbation solut ion to the determinantal equation may be obtained using the solutions for longitudinal propagation as th e zero-order solution. The first perturbation of the equation will be shown to give a propagation constant for the electromagnetic wave which is r ecognizable as t he qu asi-longitudinal approximation of magneto-ionic theory for an incompressible plasma,

797

plus another propagation constant for an acoustic wave. Application of the perturbation method to obtain a second order correction is not fruitful, since the perturbation parameter is not small for all angles O.
It is useful to rewrite (10) as an operator eq uation

It can be seen that the first two eigenvalues still agree with the results of the QL approximation of magneto-ionic theory, in which only one of these eigenvalues has a positive real part for X>YL>1. The third eigenvalu e has a positive real part for YNCYi-l»X-l, which indicates that a quasi-acoustic mode can propagate over a narrow cone of wave-normal angles near the critical angle for whistler mode propagation, which is given approximately by

The d amping of either the electromagnetic whistler mode or of the quasi-acoustic mode becomes large near the critical angle, thus the acoustic mode may not be observed due to excessive damping if the cone of the angles along wh ich it may propagate is too sm all. The width of this cone can be shown to be approximately given by

Thus the acoustic wave with low damping can probably be observed only in the outer ionosphere, above the height of maximum electron density in the F2 layer.
It is now of interest t o examine the first-order approximation to the eigenvectors. These are found from perturbation theory by writing the eigenvalue equation as

[T - A]' X= [To- ACO) ] . XCO) + a[To - A(0) ]. (x (l) - XCO» + a[T1-(A(1) - A(O» ]. X(0) + 0 (a2),

(25)

where .a IS a dumm y perturbation parameter , Since [To-A(O )],x(O) = O, x (l) can be found by

setting

[To- A(0)]. (x (l)- x (0»= - [ T 1- (A(l )- A(0» ], x (O)

(26)

and solving for the vectors x (l) subject to the restriction

(x (lJ- x (O») ·x (O)= O.

(27)

This restriction enables x (l) to be specified uniquely, The new set of vectors which are found by this procedure are, again neglecting Z in solving for the eigenvectors,

4, Poynting Vector

In order to find the ray direction, or direction of energy transport, it is necessary to evaluate the power flow from the generalized Poynting vector, Thus for a wave having both electro-

800

magnetic and acoustic energy, the power density is given by

p = t R e [E X H + pvacoustlc].

(29)

For plane waves with the wave normal along the z coordin ate, this expression can be written as

{ (3 [ - - J} (wm)2 - P = 21"Re W}Lo E · Eaz-E zE+ - e- XVvzvzaz .

(30)

To find the quantities of interest, v and E from x, it is necessary to invert the transforma-

tion (15 ), finding

V = }L - l. X.

(31)

This form is appropriate to find vz for use in the power calculation (3 0), but is not appropriate to find E. The electromagnetic energy term should not depend on the longi tudin al velocity compon en t, so we fi nd that part of the electric field which con tr ibutes to the electromagnetic power How by employin g a proj ection operator,

(36)

B ecause the ratio X /V is a very large number, it is seen that the ray direction of the quasi-

acoustic wave, P 3, is nearly along the wave normal, whereas that of the quasi-electromagnetic

wave, PI, becomes very nearly in the direction of the geomagnetic field for angles near the

The wave impedance of the quasi-electromagnetic and the acoustic waves can also be

determined from the power calculation. Defining a wave impedance in the direction of the

wave normal by

the impedance is found to be

E· E-EzEz

In the quasi-electromagnetic wave, the ratio of acoustic to electromagnetic energy is small, and the impedance becomes approximately

(38)

For the quasi-aco ustic wave, the acoustic energy is many times greater than the electromagnetic energy, and the wave impedance is correspondingly greater,

(39)

As a result of the disparity in wave impedances, an antenna ",,-hich is designed to radiate an electromagnetic wav e efficiently will not couple greatly to the quasi-acoustic wave, and in order to observe acoustic wave propagation in the ionosphere, it may be necessary to employ special antennas.

6 . Damping Effects
D amping effects can b e accounted for by collisions between electrons and h eavy particles, principally positive ions and neutral atoms . The scattering cross section presen.ted by charged ions to electrons is rela ti vely very large at low electron temperatmes, due to the long r ange of the Coulomb force. H owever , as the temperatme, or mean kinetic energy of electrons incr eases, the scattering cross section of ions decreases, until at approximately 1.8 X 105 OK the scatterin g

cross section presented by the Coulomb potential is no greater than is that of short range forces. The result is that the collision frequency in the ionosphere can be extremely low if the electron temperature is of the order of 105 OK. For instance, if X = 50 , T = 105 oK, and it is assumed that the den sity of positive ions is equal to that of electrons, while the density of all heavy p articles is 10 times that of electrons, then the collision frequency, estimated by the formulas given by Cowling [1945] would be approximately 8 X 10-\ giving Z at 18 kHz equal to 4.4 X 10- 8•
The darnping of the quasi-acoustic wave will be greater than that of the quasi-electromagnetic wave , particularly near the region of coupling of the two waves. The ratio of attenuation constant to propagation constant for each of the waves is approximately

Near the transition angle, the denominator of the term on the right of (41 b) is small, giving a larger damping term than that of the quasi-electromagnetic wave. At the transition angle , damping will be greater, the smaller the value of V. For very small values of V, corresponding to electron temperatures in the range 103 OK or less, the damping will probably be so great as to prevent observation of a quasi-acoustic wave at wave-normal angles near the transition angle in any part of the ionosphere.
7. Conclusions

From the analysis presented here it appears that quasi-acoustic waves can be propagated within the ionosphere at VLF frequencies provided the electron temperature is sufficiently high (104- 105 OK). These waves will be coupled with the propagating electromagnetic waves, the so-called "whistler" mode of magneto-ionic theory, near the critical angle between the wave normal and the direction of the geomagnetic field.
The effect of losses due to collisions between electrons and heavy particles is important, and in general the quasi-acoustic wave is subject to greater damping than is the electromagnetic wave. The damping of the quasi-acoustic wave increases with increasing electron density and decreases with increasing electron temperature. Damping prevents observation of the quasi-acoustic mode in the lower part of the ionosphere.
It also appears unlikely that waves propagating in a natural whistler mode which couples in the outer ionosphere to an acoustic wave will be able to be detected at the earth's surface,
although this conjecture has not been confirmed by ray-tracing calculations. However, only waves which have wave normal directions near the critical angle with respect to the geomagnetic field will be appreciably coupled , and such waves may either be "lost," leaving the earth's field, or may be highly attenuated in the lower region of the ionosphere.
Acoustic waves at VLF may also be directly excited by radio transmitters located on earth satellites or by large-scale disturbances, such as nuclear explosions in the upper atmosphere.
The possibility of excitation of such waves should be taken into account in the design of VLF satellite transmitting antennas, as the effect on the antenna impedance could be appreciable for certain orientations with respect to the geomagnetic field.
