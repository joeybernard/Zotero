has two key assumptions. The first assumptionis that the HF beam breaks up into a number of smaller fil-

self-focusinginstability or pre-existing irregularities en-

hancedby self-focusing.The secondassumptionis that

once the radiation passesthe F-peak, each filament of the lattice becomesan independent transmitter, whose

A simple diffraction model is used to follow the HF

radiation once it exits the F-peak. A schematicof the

model is shown in Figure 2. The irregularities in the
