An Iteration-Free MoM Approach Based on Excitation Independent Characteristic Basis Functions for Solving Large Multiscale Electromagnetic Scattering Problems
Eugenio Lucente, Agostino Monorchio, Senior Member, IEEE, and Raj Mittra, Life Fellow, IEEE

Abstract—We describe a numerically efﬁcient strategy for solving a linear system of equations arising in the Method of Moments for solving electromagnetic scattering problems. This novel approach, termed as the characteristic basis function method (CBFM), is based on utilizing characteristic basis functions (CBFs)—special functions deﬁned on macro domains (blocks)—that include a relatively large number of conventional sub-domains discretized by using triangular or rectangular patches. Use of these basis functions leads to a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of unknowns, and results in a substantial size reduction of the MoM matrix; this, in turn, enables us to handle the reduced matrix by using a direct solver, without the need to iterate. In addition, the paper shows that the CBFs can be generated by using a sparse representation of the impedance matrix—resulting in lower computational cost—and that, in contrast to the iterative techniques, multiple excitations can be handled with only a small overhead. Another important attribute of the CBFM is that it is readily parallelized. Numerical results that demonstrate the accuracy and time efﬁciency of the CBFM for several representative scattering problems are included in the paper.

I. INTRODUCTION
MOST OF THE existing frequency-domain method of moments (MoM) for analyzing arbitrary three-dimensional (3-D) electromagnetic structures utilize sub-domain basis functions, typically Rao, Wilton, and Glisson types [1] whose dimensions are on the order of . This in turn, poses a considerable burden on the CPU, both in terms of memory and solvetime when dealing with electrically large problems in terms of the wavelength. Hybridization of the MoM with asymptotic techniques, such as physical optics (PO) or ray-based geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) methods, has been proposed

by a number of authors [2]–[4] to circumvent these limitations. However, this type of approach has only seen limited applications, e.g., the modeling of a small antenna mounted on a large platform, because of the difﬁculties in ﬁnding a systematic way to merge the two methods. Recently, a number of techniques have been proposed to circumvent the problems of excessive memory and solve-time associated with large MoM matrices. The impedance matrix localization (IML) technique [5] replaces the MoM matrix by one with localized clumps of large elements. The use of wavelet basis functions [6] reduces the solution time by a constant factor but not the computational complexity. The complex multipole beam approach (CMBA) [7] represents the scattered ﬁeld in a series of beams produced by multipole sources located in the complex space, but it is efﬁcient only for smooth surfaces. The multilevel matrix decomposition algorithm (MLMDA) [8] carries out a fast matrix-vector multiplication by decomposing the MoM matrix into a large number of blocks, each describing the interaction between distant scatterers. The fast mulitpole method (FMM) [9] and its extension, the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) [10], realize a saving in the memory requirements by storing only the near-ﬁeld interaction part of the large matrix. They also improve the time performance by accelerating the matrix-vector multiplications needed in the iterative solvers in a highly efﬁcient manner using a spherical harmonic expansion technique. However, most of the techniques mentioned above still rely upon iteration methods to solve large problems, and this can lead to convergence difﬁculties when dealing with objects with multi-scale features. Recently, it has been shown that the use of high-level basis functions, deﬁned over electrically large geometrical domains, can signiﬁcantly reduce the number of unknowns. For instance, the macro basis function (MBF) and the sub-domain multilevel approach (SMA) [11] have been recently proposed to handle large planar antenna arrays. The above approaches are suitable for planar microstrip circuits and antennas, however their application to more general objects normally encountered in the EM scattering problems is not obvious, and, they do not directly account for the mutual coupling effect between different portions of the geometry.
More recently, the characteristic basis functions method (CBFM) [12] has been proposed to solve large problems. It uses a set of high-level basis functions, called CBFs that are specially constructed to ﬁt the problem geometry by incorporating the physics of the problem into their generation. The

CBFM differs from the other entire-domain approaches in several aspects. First, the technique is more general, and can be applied to an arbitrary geometry; second, it includes the mutual coupling effects rigorously and systematically; third, it leads to small-size matrices, called reduced-matrices, that are sparse and well-conditioned in nature; fourth, and perhaps the most important attribute of the CBFM, is that it only utilizes direct solvers rather than iterative methods; hence it does not suffer from convergence problems and can solve multiple excitation problems efﬁciently. The CBFM also realizes a sizable reduction in the storage requirement, enabling it to handle very large problems that cannot be dealt with by using conventional techniques. In this paper, we propose further improvements of the original version of CBFM that bypass the computation of the secondary basis functions; allow us to generate the CBFs by using a sparse representation of impedance matrix; and handle multiple excitations with only a small overhead. In addition, the CBFM is highly parallelizable, which is an important and desirable attribute, since a computer cluster is almost always used to solve a large problem.
The paper is organized as follows: we begin by describing the general theoretical formulation in Section II, with particular emphasis on geometrical block partitioning and multiple Plane Wave excitations. This is followed, in Section III, by a description of the sparse MoM impedance matrix approach to generating the macro-domain basis functions. Finally, in Section IV, we present some results that validate the efﬁciency and accuracy of the formulation.

II. FORMULATION
The application of the conventional MoM formulation, based on a subsectional basis functions, to the electric ﬁeld integral equation (EFIE) leads to a dense, complex linear system of the form

(1)

where is the generalized impedance matrix of dimension

, and are

vectors, and is the number of un-

knowns. For large and complex problems, the matrix system (1)

is used to solve for typically thousands of unknowns, and this

poses a burden on computer memory and CPU time, since they

increase as

and

, respectively. Moreover, the size

of the MoM impedance matrix becomes prohibitive for direct

solvers when is large, prompting one to use iterative solvers.

However, the latter suffer from convergence difﬁculties when

(1) is ill-conditioned, and, furthermore, they require solving the

system anew for each excitation. The use of macro-domain basis

function has the advantages that it leads to a reduced matrix

that can be solved directly because it is much smaller than that

of the original MoM, without requiring preconditioners. More-

over, multiple right hand sides are handled efﬁciently once the

LU decomposition of the reduced matrix has been carried out.

The modiﬁed CBFM begins with dividing the geometry of the

object to be analyzed into blocks, for instance , characterizing

these parts alone by using the so called primary characteristic

basis functions, which not only represent the localized solution

but also account for the interactions between the self-blocks and

the remaining blocks. There is no limitation on the number and

size of blocks. The upper size is bounded by the available RAM

needed to handle the self-blocks that are solved to generate the

CBFs. Typically, the block size ranges from a few hundred to a

few thousand sub-domain type of unknowns.

Next a set of

primary CBFs are constructed for each

block by exciting it with Plane Waves (PWs) incident from

angles (see Fig. 1). The number of PWs angles is

deliberately overestimated, initially, so that the CBFs would be

invariant with respect to the size of the block, the shape of the

geometry under investigation, and can account for evanescent

waves, if desired. Subsequently, the redundant information due

to the overestimation is eliminated via the use of a singular value

decomposition (SVD). Moreover, it is important to observe that,

for a scatterer compactly supported within a sphere of radius

there is a sharp cutoff after which the asymptotic behavior

of the singular values takes hold. Fig. 2 shows the distribution

of the normalized singular values for the corner reﬂector case,

which is presented in the numerical section as the last example.

Distributions of the singular values, plotted for different blocks,

show a sharp transition region where the cutoff occurs. This cut

off can be estimated analytically using techniques analogous to

the ones presented in [13]. Furthermore, a general discussion

should also consider the relationship between spatial bandwidth

of the scattered ﬁelds and degrees of freedom [14], which is

not instrumental to our procedure and is beyond the scope of

this paper. To this end, we overestimated this parameter that

represents a lower bound to ensure the necessary accuracy. The

advantages of following this procedure is that it enables us to

solve for multiple excitations using the same reduced matrix

with a signiﬁcant time-saving since only the right hand side

of the reduced system needs to be computed for a new

excitation. As a result, this approach is computationally more

efﬁcient than the original version of the CBFM [12].

For the sake of illustration, we consider a thin plate which is

divided into 25 blocks, shown in Fig. 3. Although, in general,

the blocks can have different sizes, we assume that they have

approximately the same dimension in terms of number of

unknowns.

In order to compute the primary CBFs, all blocks are extended

by a ﬁxed amount (typically to ) in all directions,

with the exception of free edges, to avoid a singular behavior in

the current distribution within the original block introduced by

the truncation that creates ﬁctitious edges. Each of the ex-

tended blocks are represented by the

self-impedance

matrix , where

, and is the number of un-

knowns in the extended blocks. The matrix is extracted from

the original MoM matrix by using a matrix segmentation pro-

cedure. The concept of MoM matrix segmentation is illustrated

in Fig. 4, where the extended and individual blocks are shown

in dotted line and solid line, respectively. The self-impedance

matrix is then used to generate the primary CBFs induced on a

given block by exciting the block with a set of windowed plane

waves, impinging upon the object with different incident angles

, and with two linear different polarizations.

Let and indicate the number of samples in elevation

and azimuth ( and , respectively). This results in a total of

plane wave excitations, which are arranged in

block,

primary CBFs are determined for each block by

solving the following linear system of equations:

matrix, representing of the CBFs, as

yet untruncated, for block

. Next, the above

CBFs are truncated by discarding the current weight coefﬁcients

belonging to the extension region, so that the resulting CBFs are

now conﬁned within the original block, and their size is now re-

duced to

. Even though the size of the complete

MoM matrix may be very large because the original structure is

large in terms of the wavelength, the dimension of each block

can still be kept to a manageable level and, hence, the linear

system (2) can be solved by using LU decomposition. This fac-

torization is highly desirable since we have to solve (2)

times, one for each incident plane wave, to compute the com-

plete set of primary basis functions.

Typically, the number of plane waves we have used to gen-

erate the CBFs would exceed the number of degrees of freedom

(DoFs) associated with the block, and it is desirable to remove

the redundancy in the basis functions by applying a singular

value decomposition (SVD) procedure, and thresholding .

This is done by expressing this latter as

matrix. The elements of the diagonal matrix are the singular

values of . Next, we construct a new set of basis functions

that are linear combinations of the original CBFs via the SVD

approach, and only those with relative singular values above a

certain threshold are retained. The threshold is chosen by nor-

malizing the singular values with respect to the maximum. We

then discard those normalized values (set them equal to zero)

which fall below the threshold, typically chosen to be , to

set the level of accuracy we desire. This ﬁltering process of elim-

inating the post-SVD CBFs is important to reduce their redun-

dancy and, consequently, improve the condition number of the

reduced matrix. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that all

of the blocks contain the same number of CBFs after SVD,

where is always smaller than

.

It is worthwhile mentioning that the “new” primaries have all

the desired characteristics of wavelets in terms of orthogonality

and oscillatory behavior, though, in contrast to the wavelets,

they are tailored to the geometry of the object. Thus, unlike

the wavelets, the post-SVD CBFs can be used for an arbitrary

three-dimensional object, without any restrictions.

Following the procedure described above, we construct

primary basis functions, for each of the blocks. The solu-

tion to the entire problem is then expressed as a linear combina-

tion of the CBFs as follows:

...

where , for

, are the unknown expansion

coefﬁcients to be determined by using the reduced matrix, and

is the CBF of block , for

. The ﬁnal

step is to generate the reduced

MoM matrix for the

unknown complex coefﬁcients by performing the inner

product on (1) once that has been replaced by expression (4).

The reduced coefﬁcient matrix has the form shown in (5),

at the bottom of the page, where

is the coupling matrix

linking the original (unextended) blocks , and , is the

dense self-coupling matrix of these blocks, is the truncated-

CBFs matrix of block after SVD. Note that each of the inner

product entries in the above matrix results in a sub-matrix of size

, and the MoM matrix reduction involves

complex

matrix-vector products.

After performing the necessary operations indicated in (5), the original MoM matrix in (1) is reduced to a smaller one. The induced surface current distribution for the entire structure can now be obtained by substituting the values of in (4). Once the current density distribution has been derived, the electrical parameters such as RCS, scattered ﬁeld, etc., can be computed.
The most computationally intensive part of the proposed method is associated with the generation of the primary CBFs and the matrix reduction procedure. However, the latter task can be speeded up by observing that the following relationship holds:

(6)

since

. By using this observation, the complexity

in computing (5) is reduced by a factor of two, since we

can generate only the upper or lower triangular parts of the

reduced matrix. Generation of CBFs is one of the time-con-

suming and memory-demanding task. It requires the ﬁlling the

self-impedance matrix for the extended block and its factor-

ization in an LU form. Since the CBFs are independent of the

incident angles, this factorization needs to be performed only

once, and the resulting primaries can be reused for multiple

incident angle directions. This implies that the ﬁnal reduced

matrix (5) is independent of the excitation, and this fact enables

us to solve a problem involving multiple excitations by only

solving the reduced system for the new

(excitation).

Moreover, we can store the reduced matrix on the hard disk and

reuse it whenever we need to analyze a new excitation. Fur-

thermore, if the geometry within a particular block is modiﬁed,

only the CBFs belonging to this block need to be recomputed.

The technique described above realizes a saving in the CPU

running time and RAM requirement with respect to a conven-

tional MoM technique. The memory requirement is now pro-

portional to the square of the self impedance matrix of the ex-

tended block, and this is different from that in the conventional

MoM where the storage requirement is related to the square of

the dimension of the entire impedance matrix. Moreover, we re-

alize a consistent saving in the execution time, which becomes

, as estimated by accounting for the largest com-

putational burden. An order of the computational cost can be

estimated by

which the geometry was ﬁrst divided into 25, and then into 90

blocks.

It is worthwhile to point out that the CBFM is a highly par-

allelizable algorithm, because each block can be analyzed on

a stand-alone basis on a parallel platform. Fig. 5 shows the

time performance for the parallel CBF code based on MPI for

a generic scattering problem (

,

,

, for this example).

To further reduce the storage and time requirements of the

proposed method, a new approach for generating primary CBFs

is presented in the following section. It is based on the use of

sparse representation of self-block impedance matrix.

III. SPARSE MATRIX APPROACH
We recall from the discussion in Section II, that the linear system (2) needs to be solved to compute a complete set of primary basis functions. Since, the coefﬁcient matrix is complex and dense, this process may require large storage, and a long CPU time. In fact, the generation and inversion of the matrix consume a considerable portion of the total solution time. The prime contributor to the matrix ﬁll-time is the repeated numerical evaluation of the surface integrals over the testing and expansions functions involving the Green’s function. Moreover, may contain redundant information, resulting from the dense sampling rates of ﬁelds. To reduce the computational burden and the memory requirement in ﬁlling and solving the linear system (2), a sparse representation of the matrix can

be generated if we conﬁne the computation of the ﬁeld radi-

ated by the individual sub-domain basis function only to its near

neighborhood in the block. In particular, for each sub-domain

basis function, the block surface is divided into two regions, viz.,

a near-ﬁeld and a far-ﬁeld region. The near-ﬁeld region is spher-

ical with a radius equal to . Interactions within the near ﬁeld

are modelled in the customary MoM manner, leading to a dense

set of entries near the diagonal of the matrix. In the far-ﬁeld re-

gion, however, the sampling rate can be lower because the spec-

tral content of the ﬁeld is relatively low. The contributions of the

far-ﬁeld region can be neglected for the purpose of generating

the CBFs though these interactions are included rigorously in

the process of constructing the reduced matrix [see (5)]. It is

important to recognize that the CBFs are not the ﬁnal solution:

they can be interpreted as merely macro-basis functions. This,

in turn, enables us to generate these basis functions using sparsi-

ﬁed matrix, without compromising the accuracy of the ﬁnal so-

lution. In particular, we have found that retaining the interaction

within the distance of

is sufﬁcient to obtain a good

representation of the CBFs for computing the ﬁnal current dis-

tribution as well as the far ﬁeld pattern accurately. As a conse-

quence, we not only save time because the matrix generating the

CBFs is sparse, but also memory because we do not need to store

the matrix elements corresponding to the far-ﬁeld interactions

while generating the CBFs. This, in turn, enables us to enlarge

the electrical size of each block and, consequently, the size of the

reduced matrix. Moreover, we can solve the linear system (2) by

using sparse matrix solvers. Table I compares the computational

and memory costs of the proposed method against that needed

to generate the CBFs in the conventional way (concerning the

ﬁll time, it is useful to point out that a “patch by patch” subrou-

tine is used in the case of regular CBMoM approach, whereas an

“edge by edge” procedure is employed for the sparse approach,

being the former approach faster of a factor 9). It is evident that

we can achieve a signiﬁcant reduction both in the computational

time and in the memory requirement by using the technique de-

scribed above, without compromising the accuracy of the ﬁnal

solution, as we show in the next section. The same is not true,

however, for the conventional MoM, where the loss of accuracy

can be signiﬁcant when we work with a sparse version of the Z

matrix, and neglect the far-ﬁeld interaction entirely.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
The proposed technique has been applied to several different test examples to calculate the bi-static or mono-static RCS and the results have been compared with those derived by using a

1004

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION, VOL. 56, NO. 4, APRIL 2008

direct or analytical computation to validate the method. The test cases chosen are: i) a side PEC cube; ii) a radius PEC sphere; iii) NASA almond; and iv) a corner reﬂector.

A. Side PEC Cube

To illustrate the accuracy and the efﬁciency of the proposed

CBFM, we present the results for the problem of scattering by

a PEC cube of side at a frequency of 300 MHz. The object

is excited by a normally incident (

,

) theta-polar-

ized plane wave. The discretization is carried out by using tri-

angular patches with a mean edge length of , resulting in a

problem with 180.000 unknowns. The geometry is divided into

56 blocks with an average size of 4.000 unknowns. Each block

has been extended by

in all directions and analyzed

for a spectrum of plane waves incident from

and

, with

. This results in a

total of 800 CBFs for each block, but, after SVD, only 200 (av-

erage value) are retained on each block. The 180.000 180.000

MoM matrix is then reduced to an 11.047 11.047 matrix and

solved directly. The geometry has been analyzed by using both

dense and sparse approaches. Moreover a comparison against

a fast multiple method has been carried out. The sparse matrix

approach allows us to reduce the computational cost of the anal-

ysis by a factor of approximately 3,35. In fact, the total time for

CBFs generation is 2.699 s for regular approach and only 805

s for sparse approach. The total simulation time for the regular

procedure has been 93.056 s, but the most of it is taken for the

matrix reduction task. It is worthwhile to mention that we can

solve bigger problems on a parallel architecture by using a par-

allel solver for the reduced matrix. In fact, the maximum size

of the reduced-matrix, that can be stored into the RAM, is actu-

ally bounded by the maximum available memory on the solving

process. The bi-static E-plane RCS, and the relative error are

presented in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively, for dense approach,

sparse approach, and FMM, and they show an excellent agree-

ment at all scattering directions, including the grazing angles. It

is important to point out that this type of large problem is not

easily solvable with the conventional MoM codes without using

iterations even on a Multi-CPU workstation, because of large

memory requirement.

B. Radius PEC Sphere

In order to get a comparison with an analytical solution, we

present the results for the problem of scattering by a PEC sphere

of radius at a frequency of 300 MHz. The object is ex-

cited by a normally incident (

,

) theta-polar-

ized plane wave. The discretization is carried out by using tri-

angular patches with a mean edge length of , resulting in a

problem with 85.155 unknowns. The geometry is divided into

16 blocks with an average size of 8.000 unknowns. Each block

has been extended by

in all directions and analyzed

for a spectrum of plane waves incident from

and

, with

. This results in

a total of 800 CBFs but, after SVD, only 310 are retained on

each block. The 85.155 85.155 MoM matrix is then reduced

to a 4.925 4.925 matrix and solved directly. The geometry

has been analyzed by using both dense and sparse approaches.

tion, computed by using regular CBMoM, sparse approach CBMoM, and FMM.

for the 10 metallic cube at 0.3 GHz.
The sparse matrix approach allows us to reduce the computational cost of the analysis by a factor of approximately 3,8. The bi-static E- and H-plane RCS are presented in Fig. 8(a) and (b), respectively, for dense approach, sparse approach, and MIE series, and they show an excellent agreement at all scattering directions, including the grazing angles. C. NASA Almond
Next, we choose a moderate size problem to demonstrate the accuracy and the efﬁciency of the proposed method in analyzing an electrically medium-size problem for a wide range of incident angles. In this case, we are interested in analyzing the mono-static RCS of a PEC NASA almond. In fact, the CBMoM shows all of its potentiality in this kind of analysis since, once the reduced matrix has been computed, all different excitations are calculated with a very small time compared to other approach. This target is shown in the insets of Figs. 9 and 10. Its total length is 25 cm along axis. The structure is divided into 2

blocks leading to a reduced matrix size of 500 500, derived by using the CBFM, and we observe that the size is considerably smaller than the original 14.736 14.736 matrix. In Figs. 9 and 10, the RCS for both the horizontal (HH) and vertical (VV) polarizations are plotted in dBSm (dB with respect to 1 square meter) as a function of the azimuthal angle. The elevation angle is zero, and the zero degree in azimuth corresponds to incidence along the tip. The RCS pattern is computed at a frequency of 7 GHz and compared against some measurements found in the open literature [15]. Although there are some discrepancies between the numerical results, obtained by using the sparse approach, and measurements, the overall agreement is seen to be good. One of the principal advantages of the proposed method lies in its ability to compute the mono-static RCS for multiple incident angles in a very efﬁcient manner. In fact, once the reduced matrix has been computed, the solution takes only 4,5 s for each new incident angle, because the reduced matrix does not depend upon the excitation. The total simulation time, for the entire set of angles for this problem, is 8.100 s.

D. Corner Reﬂector

As a last example, we consider a corner reﬂector to further il-

lustrate the application of the proposed methodology to objects

that support multiple scattering. The geometry of the problem

is represented in the inset of Fig. 11, and the dimensions of the

rectangular plates composing the reﬂector are

entire structure has been divided into 25 blocks, each block is

extended by

in all directions, and excited by using

multiple plane waves with

for a total of 800

pre-SVD CBFS. On average, only 220 singular values are re-

tained in each block after the SVD. The original 119.600

119.600 MoM matrix is then reduced to a smaller one, whose

size is 5.504. This geometry has been analyzed by using both

sparse and dense matrix approaches, however, only the sparse

original large structures into blocks provides two important advantages. First, if the geometry of the object is only altered locally within one of these blocks, the new CBFs need only be generated for that block. Second, in contrast to the conventional MoM, it renders the CBFM to be a naturally parallel algorithm, since it enables us to parcel off different blocks to different processors while generating CBFs. Finally, before closing we mention that the CBFM can be easily extended to radiation problems by adding the local source into the right hand side of (2) in the process of generating the CBFs. The details will appear in a further publication.

results are plotted here to avoid overcrowding the plots. The re-

sults are compared to those obtained by using the FMM and

PO. In particular, Fig. 11 depicts a theta-polarized plane wave

incident from (

,

). The incident angle was

deliberately chosen so that double reﬂections could occur. The

result for the bistatic RCS for the co-polar component is com-

pared with those from the FMM, as well as the PO. It is ev-

ident that our results agree well with FMM (also considering

that our built-in MoM of CBMOM uses triangular patch and

RWG basis functions, whereas FMM code employs rectangular

patches and roof-top basis functions), while the PO does not per-

form well in the back-scattering region, and fails to predict the

RCS levels correctly at

, and

. The cross-po-

larized component is not plotted here since it is 60 dB lower

than the co-polar one, but we did ﬁnd that the PO predictions

are relatively poor for this component. The total time simula-

tion is 96.070 s when 25 blocks are used. It is worthwhile to

point out that the computational time can be further reduced by

using smaller blocks. In particular, the run-time was found to

reduce by a factor 1,95 when the geometry was divided into 90

blocks, without a loss of accuracy.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, an efﬁcient technique to solve large and dense systems of linear equations arising in the electric ﬁeld integral-equation formulation of an electromagnetic problem has been presented. Extension to the CFIE is currently under investigation and we foresee no difﬁculties in implementing it. The proposed method is based on splitting the original problem geometry analysis into several smaller sub-problems, by using a geometric division into so called blocks. We have demonstrated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed scheme via several numerical examples. We have also shown that the CBFM achieves a reduction in the CPU time and memory compared to the conventional MoM, and, mainly, it can solve electrically very large problems without the use of iterations.
