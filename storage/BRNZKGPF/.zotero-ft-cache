[1] The following comments apply to the paper ‘‘Simu-

lation study of the interaction between large-amplitude HF

radio waves and the ionosphere’’ by Eliasson and Thide´

[2007]. The main comment is that in their discussion of

simulation results, while referring to linear mode conversion

and nonlinear effects, they do not take into account the

allowance for spatial dispersion. The use of a warm-plasma

dispersion relation would be more justified for their prob-

lem. The allowance for spatial dispersion due to the thermal

motion of the electrons results in a thermal correction to the

refractive index function that has to be considered.

[2] The first remark is about their Figure 6d. In this figure,

the authors have plotted the frequency f as a function of the

wave number k using the Appleton-Hartree dispersion rela-

tion [Stix, 1982]. In their Figure 6d, the second branch of the

extraordinary X mode, which in the ionospheric context is

referred to as the Z mode, is below the reflection points of

the ordinary O mode and the first branch of the extraordinary

X mode. For the propagation of the HF radio wave/pulse

through an inhomogeneous magnetized plasma, this will not

likely happen. In their simulations, the reflection of the R-X

mode occurs at z $ 270.5 km that is below the reflection

point of the L-O mode (z $ 277 km). However, in their

Figure 6d, the reflection of the L-O mode occurs below the

reflection of the R-X mode. The authors use the electron

plasma frequency wpe = 5 MHz as a constant. When plotting

a function of z for their density profile would look like the

one shown in Figure 1b of this comment. In Figure 1b, the

label X1 is for the first branch of the extraordinary mode and

X2 is for the second branch or so-called Z mode. One can see

that dispersion curves they have plotted are for the top side

of the ionosphere. However, for normal incidence, the wave

will not propagate to the top side of the ionosphere.

[3] The next comment is for their discussion of linear

mode conversion and generation of the electrostatic waves

associated with this process. This process takes place near

the reflection point of the O mode at the resonance region

which is omitted in their discussion. In Figure 1c of this

comment, one can see the fragment (from 250 km to 300

km) of the kz funpctiﬃoﬃﬃnﬃﬃ,ﬃﬃﬃﬃsﬃﬃhﬃﬃﬃoﬃﬃwﬃﬃﬃnﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃaﬃﬃbﬃ ove, as a function of frequency f(z) = N ðzÞe2=ðpmeÞ. Here, the reflection

points of the X1, O, and Z modes are shown with labels V = 1 À Y, V = 1, and V = 1 + Y, respectively. V = wp2e/w2 and Y = we/w is the ratio of the gyrofrequency to the propagation

frequency. For oblique propagation, the O mode can be

transformed near the layer V = 1 into the Z mode. The

reflected Z mode propagates towards a plasma resonance

region V1 where it is converted into an electrostatic mode

(or absorbed, according to the cold plasma theory) as shown

in simulations for linear mode conversion in inhomoge-

neous magnetized plasmas during ionospheric modification

by HF radio waves by Gondarenko et al. [2003]. Here, the resonance layer V1 = (1 À U)/(1 À U cos2 a), U = Y2, and
a is an angle between the magnetic field and the z axis. For

normal incidence, the O wave can be transformed into a

wave of extraordinary polarization when the distance be-

tween the ordinary mode reflection layer (V = 1) and the resonance layer (V1), DR,1 = (U sin2 a)/(1 À U cos2 a) is
less than about two wavelengths of the heater wave [Gon-

darenko et al., 2003]. In this case, DR,1 $ 100 m. For the finite values a, the polarization depends on V. For V = 1, the

O wave is always linearly polarized. The polarization index

[4] In their Figure 3b, one can see that the O wave
changes polarization in the xy plane from elliptical to linear
near the O wave reflection point. For V = 1, the polarization index of the X-mode jKXj = 0, i.e. Ex = 0. The polarization also behaves in a singular manner at the regions V ! V1. One can see from equation (1) that at the resonance region

The mode conversion due to the presence of small-scale irregularities has been shown in the simulations for the nonlinear evolution of thermal self-focusing instability in ionospheric modifications at high latitudes [Gondarenko et al., 2006].
[5] Although electrostatic waves are not described in a cold plasma model, the inclusion of the absorption (the effective electron collision frequency neff) into the model can resolve the singularity that occurs when the wave approaches the plasma resonance so that absorption can

be interpreted as conversion into electrostatic waves for the cold plasma approximation model. In their model, neglecting collisions, the singularity can be resolved when the effect of the thermal motion on the propagation of highfrequency waves is taken into account by including the pressure term in the momentum equation. This would be appropriate because for the problem considered the change in the electron density is due to the non-zero divergence of the electric field, and that should also be accounted for in the momentum equation.

[7] The refractive index with the thermal correction results from the following dispersion equation for a warmplasma approximation model

waves are strongly damped with eÀwjnjz/c (eÀjkzjz) [Ginzburg, 1970]. The plasma waves are damped even when collisions are neglected. The collisionless absorption is weak if bTn3 cos a ( 1 [Ginzburg, 1970]. The authors may like to decrease their spatial grid size to resolve smaller scales for waves which may occur in their problem.
[10] We hope that these comments would be useful and taken into account in future publications.

[8] The allowance for the thermal motion (spatial disper-

sion) leads to the appearance of the third root for the squared refractive index n32 near the plasma resonance

region V1. The waves with n = n3 are conventionally called

plasma waves. The thermal motion gives a correction of the

[9] In Figure 2a of this comment, one can see the

refractive index (kz) in log scale as a function of frequency with bT = 4 Á 10À4. The root n3 (red line) is very large everywhere except near the resonance point. The maximal value of n3 is about 250 mÀ1 (2.5 cm wavelength). The occurrence of the third solution is due to the disappearance

of the discontinuity of the function n1. This solution does
not form an independent branch of the refractive index function. In Figure 2b of this comment, the function n2 (kz2) is shown. For the negative values of n2, the corresponding
