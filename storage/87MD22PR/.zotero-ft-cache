14. ABSTRACT
We present the first direct measurements documenting the origin of an ionospheric patch, emerging into the polar cap from the noon dark cusp region of the dayside auroral oval. A series of such patches were observed. The observed patch-formation signatures, in plasma density and velocity, ion and electron temperature, and optical transient signatures, are all compared to those required of the Lockwood andCarlson [1992] transient reconnection mecchanism for patch formation. Conformity of the observed signatures, to the stringent signatures demanded of these five ilndependent parameters by the tested mechanism, is taken as strong substantiation of the applicability of this mechanism. The data exclude two alternate candidate mechanisms.

[i] We present the first direct measurements documenting

the origin of an ionospheric patch, emerging into the polar

cap from the noon dark cusp region of the dayside auroral

oval. A series of such patches were observed. The observed

ion and electron temperature, and optical transient

signatures, are all compared to those required of the

observed signatures, to the stringent signatures demanded

of these five independent parameters by the tested

physical parameters, all required by the Lockwood and Carlson [1992] transient reconnection mechanism for patch creation. Then we test for the presence or absence of each of these predicted signatures. Absence of one or more would prove the mechanism inapplicable. The presence of all would have to be taken as very strong support of the mechanism for patch production, as well as for the presence of the physical processes on which it is based, and phenomena which logically follow.

2. Signatures for Critical Test

[3] The Lockwood and Carison [1992] mechanism is

based on applies a

a burst of magnetopause reconnection, voltage (in its own rest frame) along the

Xw-hliinche

in the low-latitude magnetopause. This voltage projects

down to the ionosphere where (absent of any significant

field-aligned voltage drop) it applies to the merging gap in

its own rest frame (Figure 1). The flux transferred across the

boundary, in the earth's frame, can occur by either having

the merging gap move equatorward, or be fixed in the earth

frame with a poleward flow of ionospheric plasma through

1. Introduction
[2] For southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF negative) conditions, which apply half the time, the character of the polar cap ionosphere is dominated by the presence of F region patches. Patches are islands of high plasma density, comparable to daytime mid-latitude values, surrounded by much lower plasma densities characteristic of nighttime values. While the properties of these patches have been studied for twenty years [Weber et al., 1984; Anderson et al., 1988; Carlson, 1994; Crowley, 1996; Basu and Valladares, 1999], we still do not know their dominant formation mechanism(s). Adequate measurements have been absent. Such understanding, beyond being of intrinsic interest to ionospheric and plasma physics, is of practical
application to prediction of communication and navigation disruption at high latitudes [Buchau et al., 1985; Basu and Valladares, 1999]. Here we present the first observations of a patch at its moment of creation. These are furthermore the first sufficiently definitive maps of transient patch formation to rigorously test for the patch production mechanism. First we describe below specific signatures in five independent

it, or both. In the latter case, when there is no reconnection there is no voltage and thus no plasma flow in the dayside

ionosphere between reconnection pulses (assuming no other sources of flow), so a continuous tongue of plasma enters the polar cap. In the former case, at the onset of reconnection the merging gap migrates towards the equator, crossing plasma whose flow into the polar cap accelerates with time during the reconnection. This boundary migration can bring in increasingly higher density plasma as the boundary moves increasingly equatorward. At turnoff (when reconnection stops there is zero electric field along the merging gap) the plasma flows poleward with the merging gap boundary, as the open-closed boundary relaxes back poleward toward an equilibrium configuration [Cowley and Lockwood, 1992]. Near the day/night terminator, one can see that this brings low density plasma in behind the higher density plasma, thereby "pinching off" the high plasma density patch by the time the flows have stopped (Figure 2).
[4] Stated more generally, patches occur because adjacent flux tubes in the polar cap have arrived via different paths, and patches can originate from significantly different locations
outside or inside the polar cap (e.g., sunlit sub-auroral, trough, dark polar cap, etc.). However, it is most convincing

to test this mechanism when the merging gap is slightly

poleward of the day/night terminator. Then this alternation of

it enters the polar cap, still hot from the initial transient heating of formation. These data allow for the first time, rigorous test of alternate competing patch production mechanisms.
[13] Data is taken with the single fully steerable ESR antenna, at a fixed azimuth, windshield wiping the radar elevation from 300 above the northern horizon, through zenith, to 30' above the southern horizon, and back. Other than that, data is taken as by Carlson et al. [2002], with each mapped cell measured with a 3.2 second and 50 km range resolution, and 128 s per sweep.
4. Discussion of Data
[14] During 07:40-08:30 UT (,10:30-11:20 MLT), on January 20, 2001, four regions of enhanced Ne were observed to emerge poleward from the cusp region, and could be tracked moving 600 km into the polar cap before leaving the field of view (FOV) of the ESR. The location of the cusp persisted between overhead and 200 km south of the ESR, where we define the cusp location by the signa-
tures of persistently enhanced Ne, Te and Ti, and Vi shear boundaries. This persistence was periodically interrupted by poleward surges of all these boundaries coincident with poleward launching of enhanced N, regions (patches).
[15] Figure 3 shows the four plasma parameters directly measured by the ESR: Ne, Te, Ti, and Vi, for two consecutive sampling periods with a full latitude sweep every 128 seconds. The data set starting 07:55:52 UT (10:45 MLT) shows two patches centered about 300 and 500 km north of overhead, formed during the previous 15 minutes. The next data set, starting 07:57:52 UT shows the initial emergence of a new (third) patch from the cusp region.
[16] Now examine the details of the plasma properties during this transient patch-formation time. The poleward surge of a high Ne contour defines the envelope of the entering patch {1). From 07:57 to 07:59 the poleward edgee of this high N, boundary goes from overhead to about 100 km northward (150 north of vertical). At the same time
the location of the Vi boundary, from >150 m/s away to towards or stagnant, shows the very same movement (from overhead to 100 km northward) in the F region {2}. At 07:55 the poleward edge of the cusp coincides with the poleward edge of the enhanced Ti, taken as noted above as a boundary between two different plasma populations. At 07:57, while this boundary remains, an additional Ti boundary is seen, about 100 km north of overhead. This boundary

also is coincident with the poleward edge of the high Ne and new Vi boundary location {3}.
[17] At 07:55 T. above 300 km is persistently near 3000 K in a 200 km wide latitude band from overhead to about 200 km equatorward, with lower Te outside this band. At 07:57 this high T, band has moved 100 km poleward {4}, in synchronism with the location and timing of the poleward shift of the N,, Ti, and Vi boundaries just noted. Recall the electron gas is too tenuous for Te to be an unambiguous boundary signature, but this motion is entirely consistent with our hypothesis.
[18] For the fifth signature predicted, Figure 4 shows
ASIP data from Nord which includes the cusp and poleward ESR FOV in its magnetically southern FOV. Images are shown at one-minute intervals during the ten-minutes of 07:50-07:59 UT. There is one flash of 630.0 nm emission seen in the cusp, from 07:55-07:57. This is just the precursor timing required of the hypothesized mechanism
