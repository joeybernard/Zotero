Ionospheric Irregularity Layer Height and Thickness Estimation With a GNSS Receiver Array
Seebany Datta-Barua , Member, IEEE, Yang Su , Aurora López Rubio , and Gary S. Bust

Abstract— This work develops a method by which a kilometer-spaced array of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) scintillation receivers can be used to estimate the ionospheric irregularity layer height and thickness and associated uncertainties on those estimates. Spectra of ﬁltered signal power and phase data are used to estimate these quantities by comparing the observed ratio of the log of the power spectrum to the phase spectrum with the Rytov weak scatter theoretical ratio. A Monte Carlo simulation of noise on the input signal and the irregularity drift velocity is used to quantify the error in estimates of height and thickness. The method is tested using data from the Scintillation Auroral Global Positioning System (GPS) Array (SAGA) sited in the auroral zone at Poker Flat Research Range, Alaska. For the 30-min scintillation period studied, the technique identiﬁes ionospheric scattering from a thick F layer, which correlates well with on-site incoherent scatter radar measurements of peak electron density, for an event previously identiﬁed in the literature as likely due to F layer.

I. INTRODUCTION

Fig. 1. Illustration of scattering by ionospheric irregularities. A satellite sv at zenith transmits a signal that arrives as a plane wave at the top of the
scattering layer of plasma irregularities located at height z with thickness L. The electron density ﬂuctuations Ne have some spatial power spectral density SN as a function of the horizontal components κx , κy of the 3-D wave vector. After scattering through the layer, the wave emerges no longer
planar and is received on the ground by receivers r xi .

R ANDOM variations in plasma density in the ionospheric layer of the atmosphere can cause transionospheric Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to undergo rapid amplitude and phase ﬂuctuations known as scintillation when received [1]. For navigation purposes, scintillation can lead to an increase in tracking error, and in the case of deep fades, loss of lock on a satellite [2]. For this reason, understanding the causes underlying the formation of irregularities is of great interest.
In general, irregularities may form at a variety of scale sizes, but those most effective at scattering GNSS are due to irregularities at the Fresnel scale of about 300 m [2]. At high latitudes, the irregularities may form rapidly if there is enhanced particle precipitation or polar cap patches with

favorable conditions for instability [3]. They may also convect rapidly due to strong electrodynamic forcing [4]. Scintillation may occur on the dayside, particularly near the cusp, or the nightside in the auroral zone. In some cases, scintillations are correlated with aurorae. The ionospheric irregularities in density may lie within the E region (100–150 km altitude) and/or the F region (150–800 km) [5]. The altitude and thickness of the scattering layer are of scientiﬁc interest because they determine which physical processes might be involved in the formation of the irregularities that cause scintillation.
Interestingly, scintillating signals, which are themselves a result of scattering, can be used as a sensor to probe exactly those irregularities that scattered the signal, as shown in Fig. 1. A radio signal transmitted from a GNSS satellite arrives at the ionosphere as a plane wave (arriving from zenith in the cartoon). Due to variations in size and distribution of irregularities, the plane wave emerges from the scattering layer as a distorted wavefront. However, the distortions are spatially and temporally correlated due to the scattering medium through which the wave passed. These correlations are detectable by multiple receivers on the ground.
Previous researchers have used GPS or GNSS scintillation receivers in single locations [6] or arrays spaced over longer distances for statistical studies [7]. A few notable exceptions are at high latitudes [8], [9] and at low latitudes, [2]; these were

typically used in time-limited data campaigns. Jayachandran et al. [10] maintained a multiyear record at high latitudes with a nationwide array. More recently, at high latitudes, Wang and Morton [11] established an array with which to examine GNSS receiver processing techniques in the presence of scintillation.
We have operated the scintillation auroral GPS array (SAGA), an array of six receivers, at Poker Flat Research Range, Alaska, since December 2013 to study the possibility of using scintillation receivers placed over kilometer or shorter baselines as a sensing device on a continuous basis [12]. The correlation of 100-Hz phase data between spaced receivers from SAGA was previously analyzed to derive ionospheric drift and anisotropy estimates [13]. These compared favorably to incoherent scatter radar measurements of plasma drift from the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) located at the same site.
In this article, we propose a way to use scintillating signals to estimate the height of the ionospheric layer containing the irregularities and its thickness [14], quantifying the uncertainties on those estimates. The method is based on the Rytov weak scatter inverse theory [15], which states that both the phase and log-amplitude spectra can be described as a “ﬁlter function,” a function of wavenumber as well as height and thickness of the irregularity layer, multiplied with the spectrum of the irregularity distribution themselves. Given an irregularity drift velocity, in this case from the method of [13], a single receiver’s measurements can be interpreted as scanning through the irregularity structures along the direction of the drift.
Section II reviews the theoretical formulation as shown in the literature. Section III shows how to apply the Rytov weak scatter spectrum theory to signals received from a GNSS array to estimate scattering layer height and thickness. Section IV describes the SAGA data and the signal processing used to test this technique. Section V discusses the results and Section VI contains the concluding remarks.

3-D spatial variations projected along speciﬁc directions. Let SN (κ) represent the spectrum of the 3-D density ﬂuctuations at different spatial sizes.
In the Rytov approximation (i.e., a weakly scattered signal) [22], we consider χ, the natural log of the amplitude A, and φ, the phase of the received complex signal ψ from a single GNSS satellite to a single receiver

ψ = Ae jφ + ν

(1)

= eχ+ jφ + ν, χ = ln A.

(2)

Note that A and φ are themselves ﬂuctuations about some mean value due to the irregularity, whereas ν is the random noise from other sources. In the theoretical derivation in this section, we will idealize as ν = 0 and address it in Section III-C. Scattering of a signal ψ incident at an oblique angle upon a horizontal scattering layer, such as GNSS, was
derived in [22]. In this section, we summarize the results
derived therein. The incident GNSS signal has a wavenumber k = 2π/λ,
e.g., λ = λL1 = 19 cm for GPS L1 frequency used in this work. The GNSS signal traveling along the direction zˆr is oblique to the scattering layer, arriving with azimuth angle β and nadir angle γ (see Fig. 9(a) and the Appendix more generally for relevant coordinate systems used in this derivation). An xˆ, yˆ, zˆ coordinate system is oriented such that the propagation direction zˆr is in the xˆ zˆ plane, with zˆ pointing downward. Writing κ in these coordinates

κ = κx xˆ + κy yˆ + κz zˆ

(3)

where κx is the horizontal component in the plane of the raypath, κz is the vertical component in the plane, and κy is the component normal to the plane of propagation. To account
for effective raypath distances through the irregularity slab for oblique propagation, deﬁne Le, ze

Le = L sec γ , ze = z sec γ .

II. BACKGROUND THEORY: PROPAGATION OF AN OBLIQUE WAVE
The problem of 3-D, time-evolving electromagnetic propagation through an arbitrary anisotropic, inhomogeneous random medium has been studied by many authors [15]–[21]. Typically, one starts with the electrodynamic wave equation and makes the assumptions that the temporal variations of the irregularities are much slower than the wave period (i.e., irregularities are “frozen in” to the background plasma) and the characteristic size of the irregularities is much greater the wavelength.
Consider a horizontal ionospheric irregularity layer meeting these criteria. An electromagnetic wave traveling from the satellite through the ionosphere to a receiver on the ground will propagate through the irregularity slab. Let L be thickness and z be the height of the top of this irregularity layer (see Fig. 1). Let κ represent a 3-D wave vector. Since there are three spatial dimensions of the irregularity layer, density variations in space can be Fourier transformed into a spatial frequency distribution of the irregularities, along the vector components of κ. The wavevector κ (in units of rad/m) lets us examine

In [22], the log-amplitude and phase ﬂuctuation spectra in the horizontal plane are given with an integral over the zˆ-direction. Then, it is shown that for a uniform layer of thickness L, this can be integrated from z = 0 to a ﬁnal altitude z to give the log-amplitude spatial spectrum Sχ and phase spatial spectrum Sφ in the horizontal xˆ-yˆ plane for a thick uniform isotropic layer [22, eq. (31)]

of the magnitude of the wave vector components in the plane perpendicular to the propagation direction, i.e., orthogonal to zˆr . The form of g given in (9) appears in [22], which [15] simpliﬁed using a sum-to-product trigonometric identity to obtain the form in (10).
In (5) and (6), the quantities in the brackets are known as the “spatial ﬁlter functions” by which the spectrum of plasma density variations SN is transformed into the spectrum of signal log-amplitude and phase variations, respectively. This derivation makes no distinction between diffractive and refractive effects; all ionospheric scattering is modeled for the assumptions stated.

III. APPLICATION OF THEORY TO GNSS SIGNALS FOR SCATTERING LAYER ESTIMATION

A. Theoretical Ratio of the Spectra

For a GNSS signal, k and γ are known. Suppose that the

horizontal components of the wave vector κx , κy needed for α in (8) are known. Then, the ratio of the log-amplitude spectrum

in (5) to the phase spectrum (6) gives a theoretical Rytov

spectral ratio Rr

Rr (z, L) =

Sχ Sφ

=

1 − sinc( p) cos(q) 1 + sinc( p) cos(q)

(11)

where sinc ≡ sin(x)/x is the unnormalized sinc function. The ratio does not depend on the spectrum of the irregu-
larities SN but on the thickness L and top height z of the scattering layer and wavevector κ. In the limit, as κ goes to zero, sinc( p) → 1, which makes Rr → 0. As κ → ∞, the sinc function limit is 0 such that Rr → 1. For low wavenumbers, the ratio approaches 0, and for high wavenumbers, the ratio
approaches the limit of 1.
The method presented in this work computes an observa-
tional ratio of the spectra and compares it to this theoretical
ratio Rr for different choices of z and L to ﬁnd the best ﬁt zˆ and Lˆ . We also generate an ensemble of simulations with noise to estimate the uncertainties σz and σL .
In order to compare the observed ratio with theoretical spectra ratios, we must ﬁrst estimate the κx and κy needed for α in (8) from the scintillating signals obtained at a single receiver on the ground from a single satellite at a known
geometry. If we assume that the irregularities are frozen into
the background plasma and drifting with horizontal velocity v = vvˆ, then as the irregularities drift past one receiver, a received signal over time will sample the spatial variations κ of amplitude and phase along the direction of the drift vˆ. Therefore, for the horizontal components of κ, with one receiver, we observe the component κv that is aligned along the irregularity drift velocity direction vˆ

κv = κ · vˆ.

(12)

Using the detrended, ﬁltered signal ψ(t) from one receiver,

the full κx and κy are not independently observable, but only

the components κx and κy along the direction of vˆ

where the rotation matrices xyz RNED and NED Rvwu are deﬁned in the Appendix. The angle θ is the irregularity drift direction measured counterclockwise from east and β is the azimuth
direction of the satellite measured clockwise from north (see Fig. 9). Substituting these expressions κx and κy for κx and κy into the observable part of α which we deﬁne as α , we ﬁnd

In (11), we replace α with the observable α . The drift speed v

and direction θ of the irregularities can be estimated from the

method shown by [13]. With the speed v known, variations

in frequency space f are related to wavenumber κv along the direction of drift as

κv

=

2π f v

.

(17)

This κv can be substituted into (16) for use in (11).

B. Observed Ratio of Spectra
Our objective is to estimate thickness L and height z by comparing the theoretical ratio Rr in (11) to an observed ratio Ro. Obtaining Ro requires a detrended, ﬁltered time series ψ(t) from a single receiver-satellite pair containing the observed log amplitude χˆ and phase φˆ , where the hat symbol denotes observed rather than theoretical quantity. The power spectrum of each is computed by taking the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation of χˆ and φˆ. This gives the observed spectra Sˆ as a function of frequency f
Sˆχ = F {ρ < χˆ (t), χˆ (t) >}, Sˆφ = F {ρ < φˆ (t), φˆ (t) >}.
(18)

We transform the spectra from frequency space f to wavenumber space κv using (17). Then, the ratio of the observed spectra is computed to form

Ro(κv )

=

Sˆχ Sˆφ

(κv (κv

) )

.

(19)

Given a received scattered signal whose observed spectrum

ratio Ro we compute, we can then compare the Rytov model ratio Rr to the observed ratio Ro of log-amplitude to phase

power spectrum for different choices of thickness L and height

z. To select the best ﬁt ratio, we will minimize the mean

squared error between an observed spectrum ratio and the

theoretical ratio via iteration to determine the best estimates

For this study, the values for v and θ are estimated from a previous step [13]. These are used to compute κv in (17). This is used to compute α in (16) and substitute into (11) to generate a Rytov model ratio Rr . In the expressions, k, γ , and β are known. We test different values of L and z over a
search space to minimize (20).

C. Estimation of Uncertainty

For the signal introduced in (2), we ignored the noise to derive the theoretical Rytov spectral ratio Rr in (11). The theoretical treatments do not model nonionospheric effects: satellite range and velocity effects on the phase, satellite and receiver clock errors, multipath, and thermal noise. Detrending and ﬁltering observational data help to reduce these effects in a measured signal. Traditionally, GPS receivers have used a 0.1-Hz ﬁlter cutoff [23]. A signiﬁcant amount of recent ionospheric research has focused on the appropriate ﬁltering of GNSS measurements to separate refractive from diffractive ionospheric effects [6], [24], [25]. For scientiﬁc investigations interested in separating refractive from diffractive effects, setting a ﬁltering cutoff frequency dependent on the Fresnel frequency may be useful [6]. This work relies on the Rytov weak scatter theory summarized by Yeh and Liu [15], which makes no distinction in the scatter. For this reason, a standard cutoff frequency is still reasonable for use as long as there is some power ﬂuctuation above the noise level.
Actual GNSS signals are noisy and introduce uncertainty into our estimates of scattering layer height and thickness. However, the transformations of that signal that yield the observed Rytov spectrum ratio Ro are nonlinear (e.g., a ratio of Fourier transforms). In addition, the transformation from frequency to wavenumber κv relies on an estimate of the speed v, and the relationship of κv to components κx and κy depends on an estimate of the drift direction θ , both of which will have measurement uncertainty.
To estimate the uncertainty in our estimate given the nonlinear processing, we create an ensemble of N simulations of noise ν we add to our complex signals. For each ensemble member n, we take the complex signal ψi from the i th receiver of the number of receivers nrx in the array and add simulated noise to it

ψ˜ in = ψi + νin

(21)

ν = Aν exp( j φν)

(22)

Aν ∼ N (0, σA)

(23)

φν ∼ N (0, σφ)

(24)

where N (μ, σ ) indicates a Gaussian distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ . For a strong signal with A Aν, each of the random amplitude Aν and the random phase φν may be considered normally distributed [26]. We also assume stationarity for the duration of the data segment (typically 30–60 s).
The height and thickness estimation relies on some knowledge of the drift velocity and its uncertainty. In this work, we use the spaced receiver method mentioned in [13]. Since that method also relies on an ensemble of simulated noise, we use the complex form of noise simulation as given by (21)–(24), to compute a best estimate of speed d v p and direction dθ p and their uncertainties σv , σθ . Then, for the height and thickness estimation, we generate simulated velocities as a random variable whose mean and uncertainty are those estimated by the spaced receiver method

vin = N (d v p, σv )

(25)

θin = N (d θ p, σθ ).

(26)

Alternatively, if the velocity is known or estimated by some

other means (e.g., radar measurements), the random variables

of speed vin and direction θin may be generated from that.

IV. METHOD: APPLICATION TO SAGA POWER AND PHASE DATA
To test these methods, we use data from SAGA on 8 December 2013, during which scintillation was observed on satellite pseudo-random number (PRN) 23. SAGA consists of up to seven connected autonomous space environment sensors (CASES) scintillation receivers sited at baseline distances ranging from about 200 m to 3 km apart [12]. An arraywide interval of scintillation received from GPS satellite PRN 23 at L1 was detected from about 03:43–04:17 UT using scintillation indices [13], [27]. These 100-Hz measurements are then processed for the time periods identiﬁed by techniques detailed in [28] to obtain detrended and ﬁltered high-rate amplitude/phase observations. In effect, the phase measurements of a possibly scintillating channel and nonscintillating channel are differenced to reduce receiver clock effects, and a sixth-order high-pass Butterworth ﬁlter with 0.1-Hz ﬁlter cutoff is applied to the differenced phase. For power observations, the raw power is ﬁltered by a low-pass Butterworth ﬁlter to produce low-pass-ﬁltered power. Dividing raw power by the ﬁltered product gives the ﬁnal power. Note that the phase ﬁltering technique does not detect or correct cycle slips, and therefore, the ﬁnal phase value may be more than a complete cycle (> 2π rad).

Estimated drift (c) speeds and (d) directions based on the data shown in (b) using method mentioned in [13]. The dark purple estimates marked with “x” are discarded and not used in the subsequent analysis.
The time series of the detrended, ﬁltered power and phase over time ψ(t) from each receiver in the array is shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b). While power ﬂuctuations at 03:50 and 03:55 UT are on the order of 5 dB, the weak ﬂuctuation assumption may still be considered reasonable (see [29] for examples and a deﬁnition of deep fading). Segments of 100-Hz data that are continuous array-wide are identiﬁed. Any phase or time discontinuities are discarded from the estimation process. As a result, any strong scintillations that lead to measurement discontinuities are discarded, which implicitly helps keep the data considered in the weak-ﬂuctuation regime.
We follow the processing described in the ﬂowchart in Fig. 3. We start with a detrended, ﬁltered signal ψi (t) between one receiver-satellite pair, of duration between 30 and 60 s continuously without any missing data. The signal has associated log amplitude χ(t) and phase φ(t). We add normally distributed complex noise to the signal for each of N = 10 simulations, for the i th receiver of the nrx = 5 receivers to create ψ˜ in. The noise is zero mean on both amplitude and phase, and we use σχ = 0.1 and σν = 6.7°. For ease of implementation we add the noise after detrending and ﬁltering the original signal. As a result our estimated uncertainties are expected to be conservative, since the ﬁltering would otherwise remove some of the simulated noise. For each ψ˜ in we compute the power spectrum of the log amplitude

Sˆχin ( f ) and the phase Sˆφin ( f ) via Fourier transform, as given by (18). Speciﬁcally, using Welch’s method [30] with a

Hamming window of duration 1/8 the data segment, with 50%

overlap, the spectrum is computed as a function of frequency

over the interval f = [0, 0.5 fs ], where fs = 100 Hz is the

sampling frequency.

The 100-Hz phase data are used to estimate drift velocities

given by d v p and d θ p of the irregularities via the spaced-

receiver method assuming motion of ionospheric pierce points

at 250 km altitude [13]. The velocity estimates and uncer-

tainties are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). Using v = dv p

and θ = d θ p as the mean drift speed and direction with

associated standard deviations σv and σθ , we generate normally

distributed estimated velocities vin and θin to transform the

that minimize the mean-squared error between the theoretical

and observed ratios, R˜rn,i and R˜on,i , for each simulation n and

For the nonlinear ﬁtting of the theoretical ratio to the

observed ratio, heights are tested from z = [90, 1000] km

with a step size of 5 km and L = [5, 500] km at 5 km step

size and subject to the requirement that z − L ≥ 80 km. The

limit on thickness enforces that the scattering layer does not

extend all the way to the ground but must end at the bottom

of the ionosphere in order to remain physically realistic.

We select the best ﬁt spectrum as the one that minimizes the

mean-squared error in (27) between the observed and mea-

sured ratios. Considering that the Rytov approximation tends

to be smoother than the actual signal spectra [15], the mean-

squared errors 2 are computed for the portion of the spectral

ratios between κv corresponding to the minimum value of the ratio and κv three times larger than the lowest wavenumber at

which the ratio exceeds 1. This captures the limit approaching

κv → 0 and the sinc · cos product within a couple of cycles,

without weighting the noisier high wavenumbers too highly.

This is repeated for all N simulations for a single receiver and all nrx receivers. A mean thickness and height Lˆ and zˆ and the standard deviation σL and σz are obtained from the complete set of all nrx · N simulations.

In this work, we illustrate the method with one 45-s data

sample and show the cost function over the search space.

We show the best ﬁts for each receiver’s N signal simulations

during this time interval. Then, we will summarize the mean

and uncertainties in the estimates made by the array over the

30 min during which scintillation was observed.

From κv = 7 × 10−4 rad/m where the phase spectrum peaks, the ratio of spectra rises, peaking at about κmax = 10−2 rad/m. For κv > κmax, the ratio tends to drop slightly and oscillate and ﬂatten out at a value of about 1, but is noisier. This can be explained by the theoretical ratio of (11), which approaches 1 because the sinc function decreases with increasing argument (in this case, wavenumber) and magnitude of cosine lies within interval [−1, 1]. The observed ratio appears to be 1 at high wavenumber as well, although due

to high-frequency noise, it does not asymptotically approach 1. Physically, this means that while the spectra follow power laws, at high frequencies, random variations mean that there is no power-law scaling. The effects of the signal noise and the uncertainty in the velocity estimate on the spectra and ratio are shown for one simulation in Fig. 5. The noise simulation gives the log-amplitude spectrum (cyan), phase (green), and ratio (magenta). At low wavenumber, the log-amplitude spectral power is reduced by nearly an order of magnitude.

is not signiﬁcantly altered in this wavenumber regime. At high
wavenumber, the noise simulation increases the power in both
of the spectra, relative to the “noise-free” spectra, above about 3 × 10−2 rad/m by about one order of magnitude. However, the ratio for the noisy simulation is close to the same order
of magnitude as the ratio of the original signal. The effect of
adding noise to the signal in a simulation reduces the ratio
between the peak of the phase spectrum and the peak of the
log-amplitude spectrum but maintains the same trend, rolling
off toward 0 with decreasing wavenumber. Fig. 6 shows the cost 2 as color, over the L and z search
space for ﬁtting the theoretical Rytov ratio to the one simulated observed ratio R˜on,i shown in magenta in Fig. 5. The estimated thickness and top height of the irregularity slab for this one
simulation for one receiver, circled in magenta, are 30 and
110 km, respectively, with a minimum mean-squared error of m2 in = 0.73 for this simulation. The error values in the search space fall into two distinct areas, one yellow (2 ≥ 5) and the other blue (2 ≤ 2). Within the blue error regions, there are two local minima, one the global minimum at (L, z) = (30, 110) km and the other a local minimum as a thick F layer around (L, z) = (400, 500) km.
The best theoretical ﬁts Rr (cyan) with minimized mean-squared errors m2 in and the observed ratios Ron,i have been plotted for each receiver’s ﬁrst simulation (red) in Fig. 7. Vertical dashed lines bound the range of κv over which the ﬁt is performed. Each of the cyan curves was generated for
the choice of L and z that minimized the cost function.
The optimal theoretical ratios (cyan) are, as expected, much
smoother than the observed ratios (red) obtained through Welch’s method. Although the ﬁts appear poor over κv = [10−3, 10−2] rad/m since the two curves are offset because the spectra are plotted on a log scale, differences are only of
the order of the higher curve. At low wavenumbers, this is of order 10−3. The important features to match are the ﬁrst
peak and the ﬁrst oscillation in the theoretical curve, where
the ratio is of order 1.

The best ﬁt for the cost function shown in Fig. 6 for IIT-1 does not appear to match the ﬁrst peak and oscillation well. However, the best ﬁts for all the other receivers in this simulation tend toward a better ﬁt, matching the ﬁrst peak and oscillation with a thicker, higher scattering layer. Taking the mean and standard deviation of all ten simulations and ﬁve receivers, we obtain Lˆ = 410 km with standard deviation of σL = 65 km and height zˆ = 540 km, σz = 57 km.
B. Estimation Over an Extended Period
The ﬁtting process is extended to the whole scintillation period that occurred 03:43–04:17 UT [13]. Each receiver’s data is divided into continuous time series typically 30–60 s in duration, and all receivers are used to make estimates of Lˆ and zˆ. If the prior drift velocity estimation fails to return a valid velocity [as indicated by the dark purple “x” in Fig. 2(c)] [13], no estimates Lˆ and zˆ are made.
Fig. 8(a) and (b) shows the error bar plots of estimated thickness Lˆ and height zˆ, respectively. Over time, the estimated thickness Lˆ ﬂuctuates between 100 and 500 km, while the top height zˆ ranges from 400 to 700 km. Uncertainties are generally on the order of 100 km.
For evaluation purposes, SAGA irregularity slab estimates are compared to PFISR measured electron density Ne as a function of altitude and time, shown in Fig. 8(c). As in [27] PFISR long pulse measurements are plotted above 195 km and alternating code measurements are plotted below 195 km altitude. The color indicates an F region density enhancement;

temperatures are enhanced during this period as well (not shown), attributed to energetic particle precipitation [12]. Most of the SAGA estimates of the scattering layer appear to encompass the F layer. Interestingly, layer estimates from 03:55 to 04:05 UT happen to fall inside the most dense region over the 34 min, descending during that time into the lower F layer and possibly the E layer, just as the PFISR densities increase at lower altitudes. The ﬁrst couple of estimates around 03:43– 03:45 UT does also, but at this time, there are no alternating code measurements (i.e., PFISR data below 195 km). There are layer estimates 0345–0350 UT that seem to extend into the E layer despite low densities measured by PFISR there.
There are a few factors regarding the cost function and search process worth considering. First, the optimal ﬁt is somewhat dependent on the techniques by which signal spectra are computed. In this work, Welch’s method is implemented with zero padding and overlapping ﬁltering windows, making the observed ratio smoother than what a basic periodogram would achieve. Redeﬁning the cost function to minimize the difference between the log of the spectral ratios affects the estimates of height and thickness. Given the effect of the simulated noise amplitude on the log-amplitude spectrum, the difference of the logarithms would need to be used carefully. These details are under further investigation.

The lack of observability of the component of κ orthogonal to the drift direction in the horizontal plane makes κx and κy incomplete observations of κx and κy. We have partly addressed that by accounting for variations in drift direction but have no direct observability in the orthogonal direction. The limit in which there is no variation with wavenumber in the velocity-perpendicular direction corresponds to irregularities that are inﬁnitely long in the horizontal drift-perpendicular direction. For such a case, there is a strong anisotropy in the length scale of irregularities in one direction versus the other. The magnitude and orientation of anisotropy of the irregularities are estimated in the drift estimation step [13], so it might be possible to leverage that information toward a better estimate of height and thickness in the future.
The velocity estimation method used in this work [13] accounted for GNSS satellite motion by assuming scattering occurs at 250 km and removing satellite raypath motion at that altitude. The estimate of height zˆ obtained here could be fed back to reﬁne the velocity estimate, iteratively improving the SAGA array estimates of irregularity properties.
There were a number of assumptions made in this work that may also impact the outcome. We assumed a strong signal to justify Gaussian noise on phase. However, for a weak signal, the distribution approaches a uniform distribution over the interval [−π/2, π/2], as shown analytically and by simulation [26]. While possible to conﬁrm with data in principle, in practice, fades are unlikely to last long enough for the distribution to be stationary. During scintillation, in which the signal power may be fading, it is possible that the uniform distribution becomes necessary, particularly in the case of deep fades (more than 25 dB) such as might be encountered for GNSS receivers at low latitudes [31]. More generally, the noise distribution used in the simulation might need to be a function of the power ﬂuctuation. A weak signal might also imply strong scatter in which case this method’s initial assumptions would need to be reconsidered; Rytov theory does not apply to cases of strong scatter.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this work, we compare the Rytov weak scatter ﬁlter function model to the spectrum of high-rate scintillation power and phase data segments to make estimates of the scattering layer altitude and thickness. The data are obtained from the Scintillation Auroral GPS Array (SAGA) sited at Poker Flat Research Range, Alaska [12]. While the method is based on well-documented weak scatter theory, to our knowledge, this method has not been used before because scintillating signals are not typically colocated with a measurement of the associated drift speed and direction.
A 45-s time series from one single receiver is analyzed and illustrated as a case study of this process. The ﬁtting procedure is then applied to an extended period during which scintillation is detected. We compared the SAGA estimates of scattering layer top height and thickness to the nearby incoherent scatter radar that provides independent means of sensing the ionospheric plasma density. It is worth noting in this comparison that the incoherent scatter radar beams are not typically collocated with the GPS line of sight. In light of

where β is the azimuth angle of zˆr measured clockwise from north nˆ and θ is the drift direction of the irregularities, measured counterclockwise from east. Other components κw and κu could be computed similarly, but these are not observable
by the array.

these caveats, the SAGA estimates compare favorably and may be another means of estimating the altitude of the scattering layer. In addition to incoherent scatter radar data, SAGA as a single instrument can be compared to auroral all-sky images, for which the intensity of different emissions gives an indirect indication of altitude. In particular, in the F region, though, the 630.0-nm (red) emission can be occurring at a wide range of altitudes. Such estimates can inform physics-based phase screen modeling of scintillation such as SIGMA [32], reducing the dimensionality of the parameter space over which the model must be run to simulate scintillation conditions.

APPENDIX

The incoming signal has raypath given by a line-of-sight

unit vector zˆr [see Fig. 9(a)]. In Section II, a coordinate system xˆ, yˆ, and zˆ was deﬁned with zˆ downward such that the raypath

direction of the wave, given by the unit vector zˆr , lays in the xˆ zˆ

plane. Now, let there be a local north, east, and down (NED) frame with the corresponding nˆ, eˆ, and dˆ components [see

Fig. 9(b). Then, zˆr is a unit vector with azimuth β and nadir angle γ with respect to the NED coordinate system, as shown

in Fig. 9(a) and (b).

The xˆ, yˆ, and zˆ coordinate system relates to the local NED

system through a rotation matrix with azimuth β measured

along with the general ionospheric ﬂow at a horizontal velocity

drift direction in the horizontal plane vˆ, the orthogonal direc-
