ABSTRACT | Efficient multiscale electromagnetic simulations
require several major challenges that need to be addressed, such as flexible and robust geometric modeling schemes, efficient and stable time-stepping methods, etc. Due to the versatile choices of spatial discretization and temporal integration, discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) methods can be very promising in simulating transient multiscale problems. This paper provides a comprehensive review of different DGTD schemes, highlighting the fundamental issues arising in each step of constructing a DGTD system. The issues discussed include the selection of governing equations for transient electromagnetic analysis, different basis functions for spatial discretization, as well as the implementation of different time-stepping schemes. Numerical examples demonstrate the advantages of DGTD for multiscale electromagnetic simulations.

I. INTRODUCTION
Realistic system level electromagnetic problems such as electromagnetic interference (EMI) and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) are often multiscale. Take the simulation of reverberation chamber shown in Fig. 1 as an example: electrically fine structures with details much smaller than a typical wavelength, such as the thin metallic mode stirrers as well as details of devices under testing, and electrically coarse structures comparable to or larger than a typical wavelength, such as the empty space insider the chamber, coexist in one system. To simulate this type of multiscale problems in time domain is the subject of this contribution.
Simulating transient multiscale problems can be very challenging for the conventional finite-difference timedomain (FDTD) method and the finite-element timedomain (FETD) method. The FDTD method [1], [2] requires an orthogonal grid. Thus, a high discretization density required to capture the geometric characteristics of electrically fine structures will lead to a large number of wasted unknowns in the electrically coarse domains. The subgridding technique [3] can alleviate this issue of the FDTD method; however, it will spoil the simple data structure of the standard FDTD scheme and greatly increase computational complexity. Stability is another issue for the FDTD method. Based on the Courant‚ÄìFriedrichs‚Äì Levy (CFL) condition [4], very small cells for electrically fine structures will lead to an extremely small time step increment √Åt, and consequently, an unaffordable number of steps in time integration. The FETD method [5], [6] is more flexible in geometric modeling. However, this

choice. Thus, dozens of DGTD variations have been proposed with different combinations of implementation schemes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive discussion of the fundamental issues of each step, emphasizing the details of one specific scheme based on mixed finite-element discretization and the hybrid implicit‚Äì explicit (IMEX) time-stepping scheme.

II. THE DISCONTINUOUS GALERKIN SYSTEM FOR TRANSIENT ELECTROMAGNETIC ANALYSIS

Fig. 1. A typical multiscale problem: A reverberation chamber for electromagnetic interference measurement with a patch antenna having electrically fine structures. The size of this chamber is 1.6 m √Ç 1.2 m √Ç 0.8 m. The thicknesses of the metallic stirrer and the patch antenna are 5 and 1 mm, respectively.
method requires solving matrix equations, either directly or iteratively. A discretized multiscale problem usually has a great number of unknowns, viz. huge system matrices. It can be prohibitively expensive to perform operations with huge matrices during time stepping.
Discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) methods [7]‚Äì[24] are promising in solving multiscale problems. First, for geometric modeling, DGTD allows for domain decomposition. A multiscale structure can be divided into several subdomains, and each subdomain can be discretized by a specific mesh density based on its geometric characteristics. Based on the idea of domain decomposition, DGTD is much more flexible than FDTD and FETD in modeling complex structures because large system matrices are split into a bunch of smaller matrices. DGTD can easily handle problems too large to be solved by the conventional FETD method. As for time integration, DGTD allows for different time-stepping schemes to be used in different subdomains. For example, efficient explicit schemes can be applied to subdomains with coarser meshes and relatively large CFL numbers, while unconditionally stable implicit schemes can be employed in subdomains with dense meshes to overcome CFL restrictions. In other words, subdomains with fine details can use as large of a time step increment √Åt as that of coarse subdomains. These flexibilities in both spatial and temporal discretization make DGTD efficient in multiscale simulations.
Constructing a DGTD system consists of several key steps: 1) deciding on which governing equations the DGTD method will be based; 2) choosing element shape and corresponding basis functions for the spatial discretization of each subdomain; 3) applying numerical fluxes onto interfaces to stitch all subdomains together; and 4) selecting a time scheme based on properties of a discretized system. Each step of the above procedure has more than one

A. Governing Equations for Time-Domain Electromagnetic Analysis
The transient electromagnetic problems can be governed by different equations such as first-order Maxwell‚Äôs equations or a second-order wave equation. Mathematically, these governing equations are equivalent, however, with different discretization schemes they differ greatly in numerical properties [25].
One type of governing equations extensively used in implementing computational electromagnetics is the second-order vector wave equation

where E is the electric field as a field variable, Js is the electric current density and excitation, and , , and  denote the permittivity, permeability, and conductivity of the medium, respectively.
One reason to choose (1) (or equivalently, the secondorder vector wave equation for magnetic field H as the field variable) is that the first family of N¬¥ed¬¥elec elements [26], also known as edge elements [27] or the mixed-order curl-conforming elements [28], can be directly used here for spatial discretization. The edge elements are free of spurious modes, which had previously bothered the society of computational electromagnetics for years [29]. Besides, the edge elements facilitate the imposition of boundary conditions at material interfaces and treatment of field singularities near conducting and dielectric wedges and corners [30].
Despite such advantages, the wave equations have difficulties in constructing the time-domain perfectly matched layer (PML), which is believed to be an allpurpose technique to truncate unbounded regions. This shortcoming makes the wave equations less attractive for practical transient electromagnetic simulations. Moreover, the implementation of numerical fluxes [31]‚Äì[33], a critical step in building a DGTD system, is based on both E and H variables. This requirement makes the wave equation with only one variable less suitable for DGTD methods.

The terms on the right-hand sides of (4) and (5) are integrals over subdomain interfaces. In DGTD methods, they are evaluated by numerical fluxes.
Choosing different numerical fluxes can lead to different DGTD systems. One commonly used numerical flux is the Riemann solver [31], [32], which is a type of upwind numerical flux and is derived from the physical process of wave propagation and reflection across an interface between two different media

Generally speaking, the central flux is a first-order transmission condition, and it is desirable for long time simulations due to its property of energy conservation. On the other hand, the Riemann solver is a second-order operator with a faster convergence rate but has numerical dissipations [15].

tion of unbounded problems because of its abilities for absorbing plane waves of all frequencies and incident angles.

III. SPATIAL DISCRETIZATION WITH DIFFERENT BASIS FUNCTIONS
A. DG‚ÄìFETD: Discontinuous Galerkin Finite-Element Time-Domain Method
The discontinuous Galerkin finite-element time-domain (DG‚ÄìFETD) method is a very popular DGTD scheme with finite elements employed for spatial discretization of subdomains. The DG‚ÄìFETD method can be viewed as a combination of discontinuous Galerkin method (DGM) and finite-element method (FEM) in time domain. All kinds of finite elements, e.g., nodal or edge elements as basis functions, tetrahedral, prism, or hexahedral elements as element shapes, have been used in constructing different DG‚ÄìFETD schemes [7]‚Äì[19]. Due to their flexibility in geometric modeling, tetrahedral elements with lower interpolation orders, as shown in Fig. 2, are effective in capturing geometric characteristics of complex and fine structures in multiscale simulations. Both nodal elements and edge elements are well studied in previous literatures, and details about how to construct them can be found in [30] and will not be elaborated on here.
B. DG‚ÄìSETD: Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral-Element Time-Domain Method
Despite its meshing flexibility, the lower order DG‚Äì FETD scheme suffers from a slow convergence rate and a large numerical dispersion. These issues become more severe in modeling electrically large structures. To make multiscale simulations more efficient, the electrically

coarse part can be selected out and discretized by higher order finite elements with a coarser mesh. The spectral elements are special types of higher order finite elements with interpolation points chosen based on spectral polynomials, such as Gauss‚ÄìLobatto‚ÄìLegendre (GLL) polynomials. By doing so the spectral elements will avoid the Runge phenomenon and lead to diagonal or block diagonal mass matrices, which are especially favorable to time-domain computations because inversion of such mass matrices becomes trivial.
Kopriva et al. proposed the nodal DG‚ÄìSETD [21], while Cohen discussed two families of vector spectral elements [41]. Due to the convenience of imposing boundary and interface conditions for both electric and magnetic fields, below we give a simple description of the first family of vector spectral elements. For a hexahedron in the reference domain, the basis functions of the vector spectral element are

C. The FETD/FDTD Hybridization Based on Discontinuous Galerkin Method
The hybrid FDTD and FETD method is another natural extension for multiscale electromagnetic simulations. It can take advantage of both the efficiency of FDTD method for simpler and electrically coarser structures and the meshing flexibility of FETD method for electrically fine and complex structures.
Significant efforts on the hybridization of FDTD and FETD have been reported since the first work by Wu [44], and since then several different FETD/FDTD schemes

Chen and Liu: Discontinuous Galerkin Time-Domain Methods for Multiscale Electromagnetic Simulations: A Review

Nicholson time integration is used in the FETD part so that electrically fine details can be modeled without the CFL stability condition restriction, while the leapfrog scheme is used in the FDTD time stepping. This hybrid technique is efficient for problems with electrically fine subdomains modeled by FETD and coarser and simpler subdomains modeled by FDTD.

Fig. 4. The hybrid FETD/FDTD scheme: Edges marked by crosses denote FDTD unknowns exported to the FETD region; edges with circles denote FETD unknowns exported to the FDTD region. The buffer zone is shared by both FDTD grid and FETD mesh, and it can be arbitrarily nonconforming to the FETD mesh [51].
have been proposed [46]‚Äì[51]. Here we will briefly state our work on a hybrid FETD/FDTD scheme based on the discontinuous Galerkin method [51]. Special features of this scheme are that it does not require conformity between the FETD mesh and the FDTD grid, and it can handle multiple subdomains in the FETD region. Since both the FDTD formulation and the FETD construction are well studied, we only emphasize the hybridization steps of this FETD/FDTD scheme.
As shown in Fig. 4, there is a buffer zone shared by both the FDTD region and the FETD region. The buffer zone grid is exactly the same as the corresponding FDTD part with one cell thickness, but it can be arbitrarily nonconforming to the FETD mesh and is glued to the FETD part by the discontinuous Galerkin method. The time-stepping procedure of this scheme contains the following steps.
1) Update EFD and HFD corresponding to the finitedifference grid by the standard FDTD timestepping procedure.
2) Pass HFD components, marked by crosses in Fig. 4, from the FDTD grid to the FETD buffer zone as the boundary values. Since in time domain the fields E and H are interlaced in FDTD region, while they are discretized simultaneously in FETD region, interpolation is needed before the exportation of HFD to HFE.
3) Update EFE and HFE corresponding to the finiteelement mesh by an FETD time-stepping scheme, such as the explicit Runge‚ÄìKutta method.
4) Pass HFE from the FETD mesh to the FDTD buffer.
5) Go to step 1) and repeat the process until the required time window of simulation is completed.
The above hybrid explicit FETD/FDTD method can be viewed as a special DGTD scheme. Numerical results demonstrate that it is flexible, efficient, and stable. More recently, an IMEX hybrid FETD/FDTD method has been developed [52], where the unconditionally stable Crank‚Äì

D. DG‚ÄìPSTD: Discontinuous Galerkin Pseudospectral Time-Domain Method
The pseudospectral time-domain method (PSTD) for electromagnetics was proposed in [53]‚Äì[55] by using a fast Fourier transform algorithm for continuous media and, in [56]‚Äì[60], by using Chebyshev polynomials for discontinuous media. The PSTD method can be considered as a special type of a higher order FDTD scheme with a much smaller numerical dispersion. This method has the spectral accuracy, i.e., the dispersion error decreases exponentially with sampling density, for smooth inhomogeneous media, if the fast Fourier transform algorithm is used to obtain spatial derivatives in a single-domain scheme, or for piecewise smooth media with the multidomain scheme. Examples show that PSTD only requires two to three points per wavelength for engineering accuracy, and thus is efficient in modeling electrically large problems [53]‚Äì[65].
The discontinuous Galerkin pseudospectral timedomain (DG‚ÄìPSTD) method was proposed in [66]. The DG‚ÄìPSTD is essentially a multidomain PSTD patched by Galerkin‚Äôs weak form and numerical flux with the Riemann solver. The concept and implementation of DG‚Äì PSTD is similar to DG‚ÄìFETD or DG‚ÄìSETD, except that scalar basis functions are used for all field components in each subdomain with only one element. As in the multidomain PSTD method, the spatial derivatives inside any subdomain are efficiently obtained by the derivative matrix based on scalar GLL polynomial basis functions; the main distinction in the DG‚ÄìPSTD is its use of a discontinuous Galerkin method for patching boundaries between adjacent subdomains. It is found that the DG‚Äì PSTD method has better accuracy and stability than the multidomain PSTD method based on characteristic conditions [66].
IV. TIME-STEPPING SCHEMES
A. Locally Explicit Schemes For a DGTD system, time stepping can be performed
subdomain by subdomain rather than solving a huge matrix system as in FETD schemes. This advantage of DGTD methods can save a large amount of memory during time stepping, and furthermore, it makes parallel computation straightforward for a DGTD system.

B. Locally Implicit Schemes When a structure contains fine details and the corre-
sponding discretized system has small cells, the stability criterion can be very strict and an unaffordable number of time steps is required for explicit time integration methods. Implicit schemes can make the time step arbitrarily large but can also require matrix equations being solved. In DGTD, the implicit schemes can be performed locally, i.e., subdomain by subdomain. This nice property of DGTD can make it capable of solving a much larger system than implicit FDTD or FETD can handle.

One additional benefit of this scheme is that both the central flux and leap-frog time stepping are free of numerical dissipation. Thus, it is very suitable for long time simulation.

1) Crank‚ÄìNicholson Discontinuous Galerkin (CNDG) Scheme: The CNDG scheme [68], [69] employs the Crank‚ÄìNicholson method, a second-order implicit scheme, for time stepping. In CNDG, the discretized system (31) is rewritten as

2) Runge‚ÄìKutta Discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) Scheme: RKDG scheme works for both central and upwind flux. For concision, we rewrite (10) and (11) as

Chen and Liu: Discontinuous Galerkin Time-Domain Methods for Multiscale Electromagnetic Simulations: A Review

In the above equations, the coupling matrices L√∞ij√û appear on the left-hand side, which means all subdomains are coupled together and need to be solved simultaneously at each time step. It can be prohibitively expensive to directly solve the CNDG system under this circumstance, and an iterative solver would be a more efficient alternative. Take the block Gauss‚ÄìSeidel iteration as an example: the pseudocode is as follows:

Generally, in CNDG, the convergence rate of each time step depends on the number of subdomains.

2) Block Thomas Algorithm for Tridiagonal Systems: When simulating layered structures, the partition of subdomains can be sequentially ordered layer by layer, and this will lead to a tridiagonal system when an implicit DGTD method is implemented

The block Thomas algorithm designed for a block tridiagonal system can be used here to accelerate the process of

solving (37). The pseudocode of the block Thomas algorithm is as follows:

In other words, the block Thomas algorithm is an iterationfree time-stepping scheme solving the tridiagonal system in a deterministic number of steps of operation. This method could be faster than the conventional implicit DGTD methods in modeling complex structures with many layers [34].
C. Local Time-Stepping and Hybrid IMEX Schemes for Multiscale Simulations
A discretized multiscale DGTD system usually contains electrically coarse subdomains with coarse meshes, which have relatively large CFL numbers when an explicit time integration scheme is used. Meanwhile, the multiscale system also contains electrically fine subdomains with dense meshes, whose CFL numbers may be several orders smaller than those of electrically coarse subdomains. Local time-stepping methods such as the multirate Adams‚Äì Bashforth scheme [70]‚Äì[74] or hybrid IMEX schemes [75], [76] can be a good fit for a DGTD system under this circumstance.
Take the hybrid implicit‚Äìexplicit Runge‚ÄìKutta (IMEX‚ÄìRK) scheme as an example, which consists of two parts. The first part is the explicit Runge‚ÄìKutta (ERK) method

regions. To our understanding, the hybrid IMEX scheme is very desirable for a DGTD system with well-separated CFL numbers, while the local time-stepping scheme may be more suitable for a DGTD system with CFL numbers spanning continuously from a very small value to a relatively large one.
V. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES AND DISCUSSIONS
As shown in Fig. 1, a patch antenna is measured in a reverberation chamber with two metallic mode stirrers. The ratio of the largest dimension to the smallest dimension in this case is 1.6 m/1 mm ¬º 1600, which indicates a typical multiscale structure. Here we use both the conventional FDTD method, and the DGTD method with hybrid IMEX‚Äì RK scheme, with comparable sampling density for fine geometries, to solve this problem and to extract the antenna‚Äôs S-parameter.
For this simulation, we perform time stepping up to 25 ns. Due to the small cells for electrically fine structures, the maximum √Åt of the conventional FDTD method is 0.089 ps, i.e., more than 280 000 time steps are required for the FDTD time stepping. For the DGTD method with a fourth-order IMEX‚ÄìRK scheme, the √Åt can be set as large as 10 ps, and only 2500 steps are needed for a 25-nslong time window. The comparison between the DGTD method and the FDTD method is listed in Table 1.
The time-varying received signals and calculated S-parameters by these two methods are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. Good agreement can be observed

for explicit subdomains, and

Table 3 Comparison of Computational Costs Between the DGTD Method and the FDTD Method for the Microelectronic Package Case

between results by these two methods. Table 2 lists the comparison of computational costs, from which we observe that the DGTD method is more efficient than the conventional FDTD method for this multiscale case.
As shown in Fig. 7, the second example is a microelectronic package structure with four ports. We used both the DG‚ÄìFETD method with IMEX‚ÄìRK scheme and the conventional FDTD method to solve this electronic packaging problem. 50- impedances were assigned to the four ports as lumped elements in both simulations. From Fig. 8, we can find good agreement of the calculated S-parameters by these two methods. The comparison of computational costs of the DGTD method and the FDTD method are shown in Table 3, where obvious advantages of the DGTD method over the FDTD method are observed in both memory cost and central processing unit (CPU) time. It is worth men-

tioning that if the conventional FETD method is used, this problem will be too large to solve on our computer.
VI. CONCLUSION
We have reviewed the concepts, the formulations, and the implementation of discontinuous Galerkin time-domain schemes for multiscale electromagnetic simulations. Several different DGTD schemes are discussed in a general DG framework. Although the authors attempt to give a comprehensive review of this emerging and promising method, several important aspects have not been covered in detail and are still in active research. These include DGTD methods for complex media such as dispersive [77], [78] and anisotropic media [79], the coupling of DGTD analysis with thin wires and circuit simulation (hybrid DGTD/SPICE) [80], and the parallel computation [especially graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated and hybrid-platform parallelized DGTD] [81]‚Äì[83]. In addition to current DGTD research topics on complex (dispersive, anisotropic, and nonlinear) media with multiple scales in electromagnetics, we believe these efficient domain decomposition techniques based on the DGTD framework will be also essential for large-scale multiphysics simulations that require massive parallel computation. h
