Solitons can be regarded as “nonlinear normal modes”, in terms of which dynamical properties of a given physical system could be analyzed. The author, however, points out firstly that the cnoidal wave is also the genuine nonlinear wave playing important roles in nonlinear phenomena in plasmas and other dispersive media. Explicit analysis for the ion acoustic cnoidal wave is carried out up to the second order on the basis of Kodama-Taniuti’s renormalized reductive perturbation theory. The nonlinear ion flux associated with the cnoidal wave is shown to have different dependence on the wave amplitude as compared with the quasilinear ion flux. At the same time, it should be noticed that the nonlinear ion flux also exhibits profound frequency dependence, which is not predicted by the quasi-linear treatment. Secondly Bogoliubov-Mitropolsky perturbation analysis of the perturbed envelope soliton is briefly discussed referring t o Karpman-Maslov’s perturbation approach based on the inverse scattering method. Thirdly, brief summaries on plasma waves in magnetized plasmas are followed by a report on the new inverse scattering scheme for the derivative nonlinear Schrodinger equation. In concluding remark, the potential importance of researches on solitons in strong plasma turbulence has been emphasized.
1 . Introduction
Facing the dawn of nonlinear physics [ l ] , we are gathering here at Aspenisgirden to open a door to establish nonlinear science with proper use of the key concept “soliton”, which has been earning ever growing popularity in various branches of sciences during the last decade. Extensive researches on various types of exactly solvable nonlinear evolution equations have been polishing up the notion of solitons with such firm mathematical tools as the inverse scattering methods [2, 31 and the Backlund transformation [4]. Regarding the solitons as “nonlinear normal modes”, we may hope to understand dynamical properties of a given physical system on a perturbation approach, of which the lowest order approximation describes the given system as the soliton system.
Carrying out higher order analysis of pertubation effects upon the solitons, we recognize that it is certainly important to investigate the interaction effects between solitons and other degrees of freedom of motion in the system. Oikawa and Yajima have developed a perturbation approach to nonlinear systems in which there exist many waves [ 5 ] , while we have undertaken a systematic reduction of the set of fundamental equations to a coupled set of reduced equations, of which the lowest order part gives rise to the Korteweg-de Vries equation [6, 71 or to the nonlinear Schrodinger equation [8]. The secularities encountered in these analysis have been eliminated in an elegant manner by

and Keener and McLaughlin [151 have been investigating solutions of perturbed nonlinear evolution equations.
In view of these recent research trends in soliton physics, we begin our discussion with the most simple example of ion acoustic mode in plasmas, in the second section. So far in the studies of nonlinear evolution equations, we have been inclined to emphasize the localized nature of solitons. We notice, however, that the nonlinear wave train such as the cnoidal wave plays a vital role in the nonlinear transport process taking place in plasmas. Hence, in the third section, we present an explicit analysis of the ion flux accompanied with a propagating nonlinear ion acoustic wave by carrying out the renormalized reductive perturbation expansion up to the second order. In the fourth section, we will turn to a brief discussion of our works on the perturbed nonlinear Schrodinger equation, referring to the works of Karpman et al. [ 141 and McLaughlin et al. [ 161.
Since plasmas are very unique media which are able to sustain a full variety of waves, we encounter various types of nonlinear evolution equations other than the Korteweg-de Vries equation and the nonlinear Schrodinger equation with the cubic interaction. Presenting a brief summary of nonlinear evolution equations for magnetized plasmas, in the fifth section, we discuss a new type of nonlinear evolution equation, which has been solved by the inverse scattering method formulated for a new eigen-value problem [ 17, 181.
In this survey, we have tried to avoid possible overlapping with other contributions dealing with solitons in plasmas in the present symposium.

2. Nonlinear ion acoustic waves

Rediscovery of the Korteweg-de Vries equation for the magneto-hydrodynamic wave [191 and for the ion acoustic

wave [20] in plasmas have been indeed the first step toward

disentanglement of the complicated nonlinear wave phenomena.

Demonstrating that this equation is by no

a specific

equation for the shallow water problem, their analysis has

given a canonical position to the Korteweg-de Vries equation

for studies of nonlinear wave in the weakly dispersive system.

electrons, the basic set of equation for one dimensional motion

[28, 291 have been carrying out a series of experimental studies in comparing with the empirical formula of Tappert and Judice [30]. Their analysis suggests that the recurrence phenomena are explained by the wave-wave inter-

In connection with the experiment of continuous excitation of the large amplitude wave, we examine structure of the (3c) cnoidal wave solution of eq. (6). It is expressed as

consistently up to the second order terms. Here, we present a brief summary of our recent work [31]. In order to proceed
to the second order calculation on a basis of the set of eqs. (6) and (8a) with (8b), it is crucial to eliminate secular terms arising from a resonance term of S($(’)). Therefore, following Kodama and Taniuti [ 9 ] ,we transform these equations into

where 6v a$(’)/@ of the right hand side of (12b) is a renormal-

of

q = g-m (13)

where P is expanded as

+ v Po 6 v = Po +(€VI + E2V2 + . * .).

(14)

Solving eqs. (12a) and (12b), we determine the perturbed potential $ ( I ) and $(2) with the renormalized velocity shift
v1 ,given as

4 vu1 = {2P(2P - QI - 7)+ (QI - YI2 - 6(QI- P)(P - 7)). (15)

Then, steady state solutions for the perturbed density are given as

,(’) = z5i(a -P)’cn4(Dq, k) + 6(QI - P)(2P - a - Y)cn2@?, k )

Expanding the three integration constants into power series,

we determine successively these constants in terms of the

e(k) E(k)/K(k) is the ratio of a complete elliptic integrals of the second kind and of the first kind. For the continuous

excitation of the wave at a given frequency w, the modulus k

is determined from the condition

+ D(a, k)(l v(a, k))(27r/w) = 2K(k).

(19)

Here, we notice that the cnoidal wave perturbation expansion
valids only under the condition of a/k2 < 1. Although the
cn2-function is reduced to the trigonometric function in the limit of k+O, the cnoidal wave solution given as eqs. (17a) and (17b) with eqs. (18a)-(18c) in the limit of k+O does not represent a small amplitude wave in the linearlized approximation of eqs. (la)-(ld).
Now, in order to study anomalous transport of collisionless plasmas, one calculates an averaged flux (6n & U ) , in w h c h the fluctuating quantities fin and 6u are evaluated from the linearized equations of a system. This quasi-linear calculation is a common approach used widely in the studies of plasma behaviour. In order to illustrate the basic limitation of such an approach, we examine the mean averaged ion flux

I‘ = (nu),

(20)

both in the quasi-linear approach and in the second order cnoidal wave approach. Based on the linearized theory for the set of eqs. (la)-(ld), we obtain from eq. (20),

(23)

The averaged ion flux in the linear theory is simply proportional

to a’, and independent of the frequency, while the ion flux

associated with the cnoidal wave exhibits complicated depen-

dence on the amplitude a and on the frequency w through the

dependence of the k on these quantities.

In Fig. 1, we show amplitude dependence of the velocity

of the cnoidal wave for the specified values of the modulus k 2 .

first order terms at the value of a 0.1 if k2 2 0.98. In Fig. 2,

we plot a quantity

+ F(k, a) = K(k)D(a, k)-’(l v(a, k))-’,

(24)

as a function of a for the parameters of k’. Therefore, for a given value of frequency w, setting w/?requal to F(k, a), we can determine k(a, U). Then, we can construct the amplitude dependence of the ion flux associated with the cnoidal wave

of Karpman and Maslov for the Korteweg-de Vries equation 10

due to the larger freedom in the choice of number of indepen- 05 dent parameters in the Karpman-Maslov approach.

The results (41a) and (41b) may also be obtained by introducing the solution with time dependent v and p into the expressions for time derivative of number of quanta, momentum and energy given by Ichikawa and Taniuti [36]. The conservation o f number of quanta is a well known feature of nonlinear Landau damping, which just causes a wave quanta of a higher frequency to turn into one with a lower frequency.
From (44) we observe that a soliton initially at rest will start to move due to the nonlinear Landau damping. This is in qualitative agreement with the numerical results of Yajima et al. [37]. Effects of nonlinear Landau damping on solitons has recently also been observed experimentally by Watanabe [37]. In Fig. 5, we show the temporal evolution of numerical solution of (25), with (40) for the initial condition

However, in order to describe self-consistent time development of the perturbation, we have t o refine our analysis so as we can determine time variation of the quantity H . Since many works being pursued are based on the Zakharov equations, (47a) and (47b), further investigation towards such a direction appears to be useful. In this connection, Gibbons [40] has reduced the Zakharov equations, (47a) and (47b), to a perturbed nonlinear Schrodinger equation in the regime of low amplitude and wavenumber.
Concerning the perturbation theory of solitons, Watanabe et a1 have developed a method of conservation laws [41]. We conclude the present section by emphasizing that investigations of perturbed solitons will provide us with useful tools t o understand properties of the physical system composed with strongly interacting many degrees of freedom.

5 . Plasma waves in magnetized plasmas

In the preceding sections, we have discussed some detailed aspects of the nonlinear propagation of the electrostatic modes in collisionless plasmas. Full variety of the modes, however, are sustained in magnetized plasmas. From the practical point of view, studies of nonlinear propagation of the plasma waves in high temperature gaseous plasma pose acute problems not only to find effective methods t o heat plasmas confined in the toroidal devices [42,43], but also to establish a new method of radio-frequency plugging of plasma flow from the open ends of the magnetic mirror or the cusp configuration devices [441.
Historically, it was the magneto-acoustic wave propagating at the perpendicular direction to the external magnetic field for which Gardner and Morikawa [19] rediscovered the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Extension of their analysis to a general propagation direction with respect to the external
magnetic field had been carried out by many authors [451. Here, it is crucial to take into account the electron inertia when cot (6) 6 % / m , even If m,/m, 1. For the magnetoacoustic wave propagating in arbitrary angle other than the
critical angle 6, defined by

6 c = tan-' [d(mi/me) -d(me/mi)I,

(51)

Kakutani et al. [46] confirmed that the magneto-acoustic mode is also governed by the Korteweg-de Vries equation. At the critical angle B c . however, the dispersion coefficient of k2-term of the phase velocity vanishes identically, so that reduction of the basic set of equations must be modified. For this case, Kakutani and Ono [47] have deduced the following type of nonlinear evolution equation.

where $I($. 7) expresses a complex amplitude of the mode. In connection with the lower hybrid heating of plasmas, Sanuki and Ogino [ 5 11 have examined numerically propagation of the lower hybrid mode in an inhomogeneous plasma.
It is very important t o notice that in the long wave length limit for the parallel propagation the dispersion relations for the AlfvCn wave and the magneto-acoustic wave are degenerate so that the above derivation of eqs. (52) and (54) ceases to be valid. This limiting case had been examined firstly by Rogister [52] in 1971, and independently by Kawahara [53], Mio et al.
[54], Mjdlhus [ 5 5 ] and ourselves [56]. They have obtained
the derivative nonlinear Schrodinger equation,

represent amplitude of the left (+) and right (-) polarized

Alfven waves propagating along the external magnetic field in the x-direction. Treating the problem of nonlinear distortion

of lower-hybrid propagation cone, Spatschek et al. [57] have

reduced the basic equations to the derivative nonlinear
Schrodinger equation with ( z , x) variables. MjQlhus [55] and Mio et al. [58] have studied the modulation instability of the

circularly polarized Alfven wave.

Since the derivative nonlinear Schrodinger equation ( 5 5 )

describes the rapid modulation through the derivative nonlinear

term, we have undertaken to seek an exact steady state solution

which is compatible with boundary condition of an incoming

finite amplitude plane wave at - m. Decomposing the complex
amplitude $ - into real amplitude @ and real phase x defined as

The propagation velocity h is allowed to take a value in the region of

(61b) (61c)

A similar analysis is possible for the left polarized waves. In the case, solitary waves are obtained just by replacing

R + - R and K + - K

in the above expressions, eqs. (60a)-(60f) and eqs. (61b) and (61c). Then, we have an extra restriction on the wave number,

K.

(62)

If the condition (62) is violated, the left polarized Alfven wave is unstable, confirming the results obtained by MjQlhus I551 and Mio et al. [59].
Comparing with the envelope soliton for the nonlinear Schrodinger equation expressed as (26), we see that the above solution represent a spiky soliton in which the amplitude modulation is closely coupled to the phase modulation. Furthermore, unlike the envelope soliton given by (26), the propagation velocity h of the solitary wave (59a) and (59b) is not an arbitrary constant, but it is restricted to a region defined by (61a)-(61c). In Fig. 7 , we illustrate the bright AlfvBn solitary wave and the dark Alfven solitary wave for the right polarization moving
with a velocity of h = 2(K + 2Q0).*

as the integrability condition of eqs. (63) and (64), since they required that the potential q ( x , t ) should vanish as x k + W. their scheme could not reproduce the steady state solution obtained as eqs. (59a) and (59b). Kawata and Inoue [18] have accomplished a generalization of the eigen value problem of eq. (63) to the nonvanishing boundary conditions, and have given explicitly the one soliton solutions which agree exactly with the steady state solution (59a) and the algebraic soliton solution obtained by us. Recently, Kawata [59] has obtained explicitly two soliton solution of eq. (66), confirming that the sum of phases is conserved during the collision process.

6. Concluding discussion

* It has been notified to the author from K. Konno that Fig. 8, 9 and 10

were subject to errors in numerical computation. The correction has
been made for Fig. 7 displayed here.

In the present paper, we have discussed certain aspect of the recent development on studies of soliton problems in
Firstly, referring to active interests on the pertured nonlinear evolution equations, we have studied an example of the ion acoustic cnoidal wave in the second and third sections. In

Physica Scripta 20

literature, we often find a statement that the small argument limit k -+ 0 of the cnoidal wave turns itself into the solution of the linearized equations. We remark, however, that the cnoidal wave solution ceases to be valid in the small argument limit k + 0, which has been recognized for a long time in the studies of shallow water wave theory, [60]. Since the solitary wave solution is nothing but an extreme limit of k +. 1 of the cnoidal wave solution, wenotice that it is extremely important to pursue studies of the inverse scattering method for the periodic boundary condition. Here, we quote a few works by Novikov [61], Dubrovin and Novikov, [62], and Date and Tanaka, [63], investigating periodic multi-soliton solutions of the Kortewegde Vries equation.
Secondly, we have demonstrated that the nonlinear ion flux associated with the cnoidal wave exhibits remarkable difference in comparison with a result of the quasi-linear treatment. In the recent experiment on the radio-frequency plugging of plasma [44], an effective quasi-potential is deduced from the experimental data as

$ * = 1.46(Ek8*/B'.69)(wPi/wci)-'.'*,

(67)

where wpi is the ion plasma frequency and wCiis the local ion cyclotron frequency. Erf is the r.f. electric field strength. It has been noted that eq. (67) indicates a clear difference in the dependence on (uPi/ucii)n comparing with a theoretical prediction of [64]. Although the relevant mode is different here, the analysis of the third section suggests that a similar nonlinear effect of the strong r.f. field might be effective in such processes.
Thirdly, we have given a brief survey on the derivative nonlinear Schrodinger equation, which is newly registered to a list of the exactly solvable nonlinear evolution equations. Steady endeavor to enrich our experience with the nonlinear wave phenomena in plasmas and other media will provide us bright hope to disentangle complicated behaviour of the systems with strongly-interactingmany degree of freedoms.

Note added in proof

There has been a careless error in calculations of eqs. (28a)

and (28b) in the paper by Weiland, Ichikawa and Wilhelmsson

[33] . These equations should be read as.

(68a)

Hence, for p = 0 eqs. (68a) and (68b) are reduced to the result obtained by Pereira and Stenflo, (Phys. Fluids, 20,1733 (1977)).
