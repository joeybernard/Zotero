Abstract
Non-linear, 3D electromagnetic coupling between the ionosphere and magnetosphere is investigated in this dissertation. The study is based on a non-linear, 3D, reduced magnetohydrodynamic model describing interaction between dispersive Alfv´en waves and the nightside high-latitude ionosphere. Results are presented from a numerical study of small-scale, intense magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents observed in the vicinity of the discrete auroral arc by the Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling in the Alfv´en Resonator (MICA) sounding rocket launched from Poker Flat, Alaska, on 19 February 2012. The goal of the MICA project was to investigate the hypothesis that such currents can be produced inside the ionospheric Alfv´en resonator by the ionospheric feedback instability (IFI) driven by the system of large-scale magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents interacting with the ionosphere. Simulations of the reduced 2D MHD model with realistic background parameters conﬁrm that IFI indeed generates small-scale ULF waves inside the IAR with frequency, scale-size, and amplitude showing a good, quantitative agreement with the observations.
The 3D model was used to verify the results from the ionospheric heating experiment conducted at the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) facility, Alaska, on March 12, 2013. During the experiment, HAARP transmitted in the direction of the magnetic zenith X-mode 4.57 MHz wave. The transmitted power

was modulated with a frequency of 0.9 mHz, and it was pointed on a 20 km spot at the altitude of 120 km. It was observed that this artiﬁcially initiated heating 1) generated disturbances in the magnetic ﬁeld detected with the ﬂuxgate magnetometer on the ground, and 2) produced bright luminous spots in the ionosphere, detected with the HAARP telescope. Numerical simulations of the 3D reduced MHD model reveal that these eﬀects can be related to the magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents, excited in the ionosphere by changing the conductivity in the E-region when the large-scale electric ﬁeld exists in the heating region.
The importance of the Hall currents in magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions, carried by ULF waves and ﬁeld-aligned currents, has been consistently overlooked in studies devoted to the active experiments. Simulations of the 3D two-ﬂuid MHD model, presented in this study, demonstrate that the Hall conductivity changes 1) the growth rate and the amplitude of ULF waves generated by the heating and 2) the orientation and the direction of propagation of the generated waves. These ﬁndings provide insight into the experiments where the waves were generated with a geometric modulation technique, and suggest a new and more eﬃcient approach for conducting such experiments in the future.

Introduction
1.1 Motivation
Ultra-Low-Frequency (ULF) Alfv´en waves carry signiﬁcant ﬂuxes of electromagnetic energy along auroral magnetic ﬁeld lines and play a major role in the redistribution of electromagnetic power, particle density, mass, and momentum between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere at high latitudes. A particularly important feature of these waves is their casual connection with discrete auroral arcs. Today there is a signiﬁcant understanding of mechanisms responsible for the generation of two-dimensional, “linear” systems of magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents associated with ULF Alfv´en waves at high latitudes. But several important questions related to the nonlinear, 3D dynamics of these waves remain unanswered. These questions include:
• What is the role of ionospheric feedback instability in the ionosphere on the development of intense ﬁeld-aligned currents (FACs) and active discrete auroral forms?
1

• Which part of the coupled MI system is responsible for the development of quiet homogeneous discrete auroral arcs?
• Which part of the coupled MI system is responsible for the intensiﬁcation, breakup, and rapid, nonlinear dynamics of the FACs/arcs?
To answer these questions, a nonlinear, 3D, time-dependent, numerical model describing dynamics of ULF Alfven waves in the magnetosphere and the active electromagnetic coupling between these waves and the ionospheric plasma is developed in this dissertation. This model is used for the investigation of spatiotemporal properties and dynamics of intense ULF waves and magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents at high latitudes.
Electrodynamics of magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions at high altitudes involving ultra-low-frequency (ULF) Alfv´een waves has been extensively studied for more than 40 years [e.g., Radoski , 1967; Cummings et al., 1969]. The initial goal of these studies was to explain geomagnetic pulsations in the Pc5-Pc6 frequency range measured by ground-based magnetometers in the auroral zone. Later, the interest in Alfv´en waves steadily increased with observations showing that these waves can be responsible for parallel electron acceleration and the occurrence of discrete auroral arcs [Xu et al., 1993; Marklund et al., 1994; Samson et al., 1991, 1996; Lotko et al., 1998]. Direct measurements from satellites [Chmyrev et al., 1988; Karlsson and Marklund , 1996; Chaston et al., 2002; Chaston, 2003; Figueiredo et al., 2005] and rockets [Boehm et al., 1990] have shown that the discrete ﬂuxes of keV electrons registered at the auroral zone are often correlated with intense, localized, electromagnetic disturbances sometimes interpreted as dispersive Alfv´en waves.
An observed connection between ULF waves and discrete auroral arcs can be ex-

plained by the hypothesis that discrete arcs are produced by magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents (FACs) carried by ULF Alfv´en waves propagating along auroral magnetic ﬁeld lines. The main questions which remain unanswered, to some extent, are how and where these waves are generated, and what mechanism deﬁnes their frequencies and relatively small perpendicular wavelengths. Some studies suggest that they are generated by interactions between solar wind and plasma in the magnetotail and/or equatorial magnetosphere, [e.g., Angelopoulos et al., 2002; Keiling et al., 2000], and the wave frequencies are deﬁned by the external driver (e.g., variations in pressure/density of the solar wind) [Kepko et al., 2002] or by the parameters of the magnetosphere along the auroral magnetic ﬁeld line, inside the so-called magnetospheric ﬁeld-line resonator (FLR) [Cummings et al., 1969; Chen and Hasegawa, 1974; Southwood , 1974; Kivelson and Southwood , 1985; Samson et al., 1992]. The main idea of FLR is that shear Alfv´en waves can form a standing pattern along a particular magnetic ﬁeld line, with eigenfrequency which matches the eigenfrequency of the global magnetospheric cavity/waveguide. Here, the coupling between shear Alfv´en waves and fast MHD modes occurs. This coupling produces standing waves with relatively small perpendicular wavelengths due to the phase mixing of the resonant oscillations [Mann et al., 1995; Russell and Wright, 2010].
Other studies suggest that the small-scale ULF waves can be generated by the electric ﬁeld in the ionosphere due to the non-linear interaction between magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents and the ionospheric plasma [Atkinson, 1970; Sato, 1978; Watanabe et al., 1993]. In general, it is possible that one of these scenarios can be realized under one type of geophysical condition and another can be realized under diﬀerent conditions. Due to the fact that the magnetosphere and the ionosphere form a very

complex, dynamic, nonlinear coupled system, sometimes it is hard to distinguish the causes and the consequences of the large-scale geophysical processes based on observations performed only in one particular location and during the relatively short time interval. One way to reveal the connection between intense, localized ULF waves and the discrete auroral arcs is to develop a comprehensive numerical model of the electrodynamic coupling between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere and to reproduce in quantitative detail diﬀerent characteristic features of the observations. Today there is a signiﬁcant understanding of mechanisms responsible for the generation of “linear” discrete auroral arcs (See Figure 1.1). However, there are a great number of observations which cannot be explained with these models. For example, observations from the FAST, Polar, and Cluster satellites [Wygant et al., 2000; Keiling et al., 2000; Aikio et al., 2004; Dombeck et al., 2005; Figueiredo et al., 2005] show that a signiﬁcant fraction of the aurora is powered by intense, small-scale Alfv´en waves propagating along the magnetic ﬁeld lines and passing through the plasma sheet boundary layer. These magnetic ﬁeld lines are stretched in the tailward direction and not always well de-

ﬁned. Such facts make it hard to explain these waves with the classical, “linear” FLR theory, which requires closed magnetic ﬁeld line geometry; although some attempts have been made [e.g. Rankin et al., 2000]. At the same time, frequencies of the waves detected in these observations are much lower than the frequencies predicted by the IAR theory and they are detected in the magnetosphere much above the altitude where the upper boundary of the IAR is located [Karlsson et al., 2004]. A number of similar observations have been reported by Cluster scientists from the University of Stockholm [e.g. Johansson et al., 2004, 2005, 2006]. Other important questions which also are not answered yet are explaining the 3D structures and 3D dynamics of the discrete auroral arcs. Figure 1.2 shows two examples of these structures: “curls” or “vortex chain” (on the top) and “rayed” aurora (on the bottom). The questions of what physical mechanism in the magnetosphere or in the ionosphere causes development of these forms, their spatial sizes, frequencies, and dynamics are the main focus of this investigation. Some studies suggest that these forms are the result of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the equatorial magnetosphere [Rankin et al., 1993; Russell and Wright, 2010]. Other studies suggest that they are a result of nonlinear

magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions at high latitudes [Keskinen et al., 1988; Lysak and Song, 1996].
1.2 Global Magnetospheric Resonator
Figure 1.3: Schematic diagram of the global magnetospheric resonator formed by the magnetic dipole ﬂux tube bounded at both ends by highly conducting ionosphere.
The shear Alfv´en Field-Line Resonance (FLR) has been studied extensively for over 70 years. FLRs can be excited in the magnetosphere by the coupling of the shear Alfv´en mode with the MHD compressional wave [Chen and Hasegawa, 1974; Southwood , 1974]. Ultra-low frequency (1 - 10 mHz) magnetic pulsations have been measured using networks of ground magnetometers and identiﬁed as transverse oscil-
6

lations of dipole magnetic ﬂux tubes [Dungey, 1955]. These transverse hydromagnetic waves form standing wave patterns along the dipole magnetic ﬂux tube which are bounded by the conducting ionosphere at both ends [Cummings et al., 1969; Streltsov et al., 1998a]. Recently, Archer et al. [2019, and references therein] have reported that magnetopause surface eigenmode ULF waves were measured using multipoint THEMIS spacecraft observations. Figure 1.3 shows the schematic diagram of the FLR structure in the inner magnetosphere. In simple terms, the FLR is formed when the frequency of the compressional signal acting as an energy source matches the eigenfrequency of the particular magnetic ﬁeld line [Chen and Hasegawa, 1974; Radoski , 1967; Southwood , 1974]. The fundamental harmonic of standing waves that are formed inside of the global resonator have antinodes on the equatorial plane and nodes on the the ionospheric ends. The eigenfrequency of the resonant wave increases as the radial distance decreases in the dipolar domain of the magnetosphere [Samson et al., 1992]. The FLR has been investigated in detail in the auroral regions due to the similarity in structure and behaviour to the auroral arcs. They are commonly seen in ground-based magnetometer observations [Samson et al., 1992] and HF radar readings [Ruohoniemi et al., 1991]. Waves produced inside the global resonator are considered to be large-scale having radial scale size of the order of 0.1RE in the equatorial magnetosphere.
In the auroral regions of the ionosphere, the latitudinal scale sizes of the waves are reaching tens of km [Samson et al., 1992; Walker et al., 1992]. Figure 1.4 shows the ground magnetometer data taken on September 28, 1988 from four stations that were part of CANOPUS array [Samson et al., 1992]. This array is part of Canadian Auroral Network. The standing wave model describes the basics of the wave structure along

the dipole ﬂux tube and signal polarization [Sugiura and Wilson, 1964; Cummings et al., 1969]. Numerical MHD Aﬂv´en models are successfully used to determine spatio-temporal behaviour of the ionosphere and magnetosphere inside the FLR under various geomagnetic conditions [e.g. Hasegawa, 1976; Chmyrev et al., 1988; Seyler , 1990; Streltsov et al., 1998b; Rankin et al., 2000]. Simulations with nonlinear MHD mode showed that these nonlinear eﬀects aﬀect the eigenfrequencies of the FLR. This

in turn changes the behavior of the global resonator signiﬁcantly. The ionospheric conductivity is changed when particles are precipitated by the Alfv´en waves, the resonant Alfv´en waves themselves are dispersed when the transverse size of the global resonator layer becomes small. Figure 1.5 shows a numerical output from the 2D MHD model where the time evolution of the FLR is investigated. These snapshots indicate how the parallel current density j grows and FLR forms a closed-loop ﬁeld aligned current system.
1.3 Ionospheric Alfv´en Resonator
Small-scale (λ ≤ 10km) Alfv´en waves can be trapped in a ionospheric Alfv´en resonator (IAR). This IAR is bounded from below by ionospheric E layer and from above by the sharp gradient in the electron density above the F layer, which also corresponds to the sharp gradient in the Alfv´en velocity. Figures 1.6 and 1.7 show the schematic diagram of the ionospheric Alfv´en resonator.
The theoretical properties of the IAR were investigated by Polyakov and Rapoport [1981]; Trakhtengerts and Feldstein [1991]; Trakhtengertz and Feldstein [1984] for the vertical magnetic ﬁeld model. They have shown that the typical eigenfrequencies of the IAR are between 0.1 and 10 Hz. The properties of the IAR are deﬁned by the medium along the magnetic ﬁeld. Parameters that aﬀect the properties include the physical size of the resonator, plasma density proﬁle, plasma composition and the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld. Experimental evidence was collected by Belyaev et al. [1990] which showed that ULF waves exist in the range from 0.1 to 10 Hz in the background noise. Figure 1.8 shows the spectrum of the horizontal component of the

magnetic ﬁeld above the Gorky station, USSR. The data collected indicates a diurnal variation of the frequencies observed in this range. Further investigations have shown that the diurnal pattern of these waves is also present at higher (auroral) latitudes [Yahnin et al., 2003]. A morphological study showed that the waves are aﬀected by the solar cycle and local geomagnetic activity.
Furthermore, both theory and experimental results suggest that the structure of the ionosphere can be inferred based on the frequencies measured. A parameter that

deﬁnes the electron density decrease above the F region can be estimated using the ground magnetometer data [Belyaev et al., 1990; Yahnin et al., 2003]. Latitudinal variation of the IAR was complemented by the analysis of the data at low latitudes (L = 1.3). B¨osinger [2002] indicated that the main characteristics of the IAR are similar to the mid and high latitude observations. The eigenfrequencies observed at L = 1.3 were lower by a factor of 2 and 3 when compared to the L = 5.2 values (0.4 Hz as compared to 1.0 Hz). Various numerical models are being developed to investigate the spatio-temporal properties of the IAR.
These models include both active and passive ionospheric boundary conditions and incorporate diﬀerent eﬀects. Model results presented by Pokhotelov et al. [2000] include the eﬀect of the wave frequency dispersion. The results show that the ionosphere couples the shear Alfv´en waves with the compressional mode. Simulations also indicate that the Hall conductivity in the ionosphere increases the growth rate of the

unstable modes. It was shown that IAR may excite the unstable modes at times when the ionospheric conductivity is both low and high. Study by Pokhotelov et al. [2000] shows that when the Pedersen conductance in the E-layer is similar to Alfv´en wave conductance the IAR generates waves with the maximum on the ionospheric ends. These types of waves can be measured by ground magnetometers. However, this is not always the case. Numerical 2D MHD simulations performed by Streltsov et al. [2011] show that when the conductances are higher or lower, the only way to detect these ULF waves is by ﬂying satellites or sounding rockets through the IAR region. Numerical studies by Streltsov and Lotko [2003] show that the IAR develops largeamplitude, small-scale waves inside the downward current channels. These regions

are theoretically adjacent to the discrete auroral arcs. Figure 1.9 shows the growth of the resonant waves in the IAR inside the MHD model used by Streltsov and Lotko [2003].
1.4 Ionospheric Feedback Instability
Currently, the ionospheric feedback instability (IFI) is the widely accepted mechanism for the generation of small-scale large amplitude structures at high latitudes. It was ﬁrst introduced by Atkinson [1970] and later investigated further by Sato [1978] and Lysak [1990, 1991]. The feedback is produced when the magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents (a system of an upward and downward currents that are connected through a background current) change the conductivity in the ionosphere by precipitating and removing electrons from it. Conductivity is directly proportional to density. The ﬁeldaligned currents are formed at the gradients of the conductivity enhancement. The upward current increases the ionization, and recombination happens in the downward current region. This results in the conductivity peak moving in the direction of the background current as indicated in Figure 1.10.
Qualitative analysis by Lysak [1991] has shown that the free source of energy for the instability comes from the reduced Joule dissipation. A consequent study by Lysak and Song [2002] concluded that IFI generates structures most eﬀectively when the background conductivity is low and there is a large background electric ﬁeld present in the ionosphere. Qualitatively, the incident small-scale shear Alfven wave over-reﬂects in the presence of a large scale electric ﬁeld [Trakhtengertz and Feldstein, 1984; Lysak and Song, 2002]. Over reﬂection means that the amplitude of the wave
15

Figure 1.10: Ionospheric feedback mechanism explained. Top panel shows an increase in the background current in the region where a conductivity enhancement is present. This increase in current is the closure of the ﬁeld-aligned currents that are generated on both sides of the conductivity peak. Bottom panel shows the propagation of the conductivity peak in the direction of the background current. This is a result of recombination happening on the downstream side of the peak and ionization increase on the upstream part of the conductivity peak. Figures are adapted from Lysak [1990].
reﬂected from the ionosphere is larger than the amplitude of the incident wave. This occurs when the ﬁeld aligned current in the small-scale wave locally enhances the ionospheric conductivity and reduces the Joule dissipation of the large-scale electric ﬁeld in this location. The ﬁeld energy is then released in the form of a magnetic ﬁeld-aligned current propagating away from the ionosphere. This additional current makes the reﬂection coeﬃcient greater than 1. When this wave interacts with the active ionosphere multiple times, the wave’s amplitude increases signiﬁcantly. Figure 1.11 shows the feedback cycle.

Figure 1.11: Ionospheric feedback instability mechanism explained.
Various linear [Lysak and Song, 2002; Hiraki and Watanabe, 2011] and nonlinear [Doe et al., 1995; Streltsov and Lotko, 2004] models are used to study the dynamics and properties of the IFI in the ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling. These studies show that the intermediate (10-20 km) and small-scale structures (≤10 km) can be generated in the ionosphere under the presence of large-scale FACs when the conductivity is low and the background electric ﬁeld is large (> 20 mV/m). 2D MHD simulations by Streltsov and Lotko [2004] show that the small-scale structures are produced in the downward current channels (depleted regions of the FACs). These results suggest that the small-scale ULF structures should be frequently observed in low-orbit satellite measurements passing the discrete auroral arcs. The conditions favorable for the IFI are satisﬁed in the return current channels associated with the discrete auroral arcs. These return (downward) current channels have relatively low conductivity and large perpendicular electric ﬁeld. Figure 1.12 shows the numerical output of a simulation where two FACs generated small-scale structures [Streltsov et al., 2010]. One should observe the fact that small-scale structures are produced in the downward current channel.
If IFI generated small-scale structures encounter a sharp gradient in the Alfv´en speed in the magnetosphere, they can be reﬂected and trapped inside the IAR. The
17

amplitude growth of these waves will be linear initially but after passing a threshold

will become nonlinear. In the nonlinear regime the amplitudes of the generated waves

are in the order of 100 µA/m2. Such large amplitude currents can produce density

cavities through the ponderomotive force, in the form of a nonlinear Lorentz force

(

and

Lotko,

Simulations by Streltsov and Karlsson [2008]

show that the ponderomotive force generated in the IAR with IFI creates a cavity in

the ionosphere. The density inside of the cavity produced is ≈10% of the initial back-

ground value. 3D MHD numerical simulations, performed with the active ionospheric

response to the large-scale FACs, show that the IFI plays an important role in the

formation of small-scale vortex chains in the discrete auroral arcs [Jia and Streltsov ,

2014]. The convective nonlinear part of the code shows that the linear discrete auro-

ral arcs can develop a series of curls based on diﬀerent ionospheric conductivity and

background electric ﬁeld values.

MHD Numerical Model
2.1 Magnetospheric Model
This study is based on the numerical reduced two-ﬂuid MHD (RMHD) model that describes the interaction of shear Alfven waves with the inhomogeneous magnetized plasma in the magnetosphere and ionosphere. A non-reduced (full) MHD model includes the physics of slow (ion-acoustic), intermediate (shear Alfv´en), and fast (magnetosonic) waves. A previous work by Chmyrev et al. [1988] has shown that the parallel ion motion can be neglected when focusing on the modeling of the nonlinear drift Alfv´en waves in a low-pressure plasma. By assuming that only electrons are moving parallel to the background magnetic ﬁeld, the full MHD model is reduced to a model that has only shear Alfv´en mode in it. The model has been previously discussed in several papers devoted to electrodynamic coupling between the ionosphere and magnetosphere at high latitudes [e.g., Streltsov et al., 1998a; Streltsov and Lotko, 2008; Streltsov , 2011; Jia and Streltsov , 2014].
20

In the high-latitude region, which is the focus region of this study, the plasma

is assumed to be magnetized and cold (β

=

pgas pmag

=

2µ0p B2

1). It was shown by

Hasegawa and Uberoi [1982] that shear Alfv´en waves can be developed from the slow

mode. Coupling of the shear and compressible waves is ignored near the resonant sur-

faces due to the fact that the plasma response is mainly magnetically incompressible

near the resonant surface [Hasegawa and Uberoi , 1982]. Due to this assumption, the

magnetospheric part of the model can be described only in terms of three governing

equations.

The ﬁrst equation in the model includes the electron parallel momentum equation

Here subscripts e and i refer to electrons and ions, respectively; ve is the electron velocity, e is the elementary electron charge, n0 is the background quasi-neutral plasma density, ne is the electron density, me is the electron mass, νe is the collision frequency, and pe is the thermal pressure.
The assumption that electrons undergo only a E×B drift perpendicular to the background magnetic ﬁeld direction is implemented. This simpliﬁes such that only the parallel motion of electrons along the ambient magnetic ﬁeld is considered:

(2.2)

Here subscripts and ⊥ indicate parallel and perpendicular vector components to b = B0/B0, respectively; Te is the background electron temperature, and c is the speed of light in vacuum. The collisional resistivity is included in the model because

21

some studies [e.g. Borovsky, 1993; Lessard and Knudsen, 2001] suggest that it may cause an absorption of very small-scale (≤1 km) waves at altitudes below 1000 km. The eﬀect of the collisional resistivity that slows down the electron motion along the ﬁeld line plays an important role in the generation of E at low altitudes [Borovsky, 1993]. It is implemented in the model as

νe = νe0e−(r−r3)/RE ,

(2.3)

where r3 = 600km/RE and νe0 is the electron collision frequency at the altitude r3. The second equation that controls the magnetospheric part of the model is the
density continuity equation of the disturbed part of the ambient plasma. The plasma is assumed to be quasi-neutral, i.e. n = ne ≈ ni, leading to the equation:

∂n1 ∂t

=

−∇ · (nv

eb) − vE · ∇n.

(2.4)

Here, the drift velocity is vE = E⊥ × B0/B02. The third equation used in the model is the current continuity equation which
is coupled with the ion momentum equation. The derivation of this equation starts from the basic current continuity equation:

∇ · j = 0.

(2.5)

It has two components: perpendicular and parallel current densities

∇ · (j⊥ + j ) = 0.

(2.6)

22

The assumption that parallel motion of ions can be neglected is implemented in the model as was shown in the paper by Chmyrev et al. [1988]. It is assumed that the parallel current is carried only by electrons, j = j b, while the perpendicular current is based on the contribution of both species, j⊥ = en0(v⊥i − v⊥e). The transverse component of current consists of polarization and displacement currents. The polarization term can be obtained from the transverse ion momentum equation:

(2.10)

√ Lets introduce vA = B0/ µ0n0mi for the Alfv´en speed. The electrons are assumed to have only an E×B drift in the transverse direction, which means that the polarization current can be simpliﬁed further

When using the full derivative form, the polarization current is

jP

=

1 dE⊥ µ0vA2 dt

(2.12)

This general expression is not applicable to the cases when the transverse scale size of

the wave is comparable to the ion Larmor radius (ρi = Te/mi/ωci). In such a case, the eﬀective electric ﬁeld controls the electric drift of the ion guiding center. This

electric ﬁeld is proportional to the electric ﬁeld in the middle of the Larmour circle

by a factor of I0(s)e−s. In this case I0 is a modiﬁed Bessel function, and s = (ρik⊥)2. All of this was incorporated into the Fourier transform of the perpendicular current

by Cheng [1991]:

jP

=

1 µ0vA2

(2.13)

Streltsov et al. [1998b] showed that the Pad´e approximation (I0(s)e−s/s ≈ 1/(1 + s))

works well for all of the s values and it can be used to obtain the inverse Fourier

transform of the modiﬁed polarization current.

2.2 Numerical Implementation of the Magnetospheric Model

The equations introduced in the previous section need to be reformatted in order to be implemented numerically. The background magnetic ﬁeld is oriented along the z direction, x indicates the latitudinal variation, and y speciﬁes the longitudinal variation. The perturbed magnetic ﬁeld component is expressed in terms of the vector potential b⊥ = ∇ × (A z) and the perpendicular component of the electric ﬁeld is E⊥ = −∇⊥ × Φ. The parallel electric ﬁeld component is calculated as

∂A E = −b · ∇Φ − .

Here ωci∗ is the ion cyclotron gyrofrequency and cs∗ is the speed of sound. ωci∗, cs∗, vA∗, Te∗, n∗ are constants that are estimated at the magnetospheric equator at a radial distance that is speciﬁc for each simulation. The normalized values used from

26

this point in the model will omit the subscript, 0, in order to keep the expressions in a more elegant form.
The three governing equations include derivatives that need to be deﬁned explicitly in order for the simulation to work. The scale factors for the coordinate system used in the model can be converted from the spherical system and are deﬁned as

2.3 Numerical Domain

The three dimensional numerical domain used in the model simulates the magnetic

ﬂux tube of the Earth’s dipole magnetic ﬁeld at high-latitudes. The ﬂux tube is

bounded by the ionosphere in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The latitu-

dinal boundaries of the domain are formed by two L magnetic shells. The azimuthal

size of the domain is deﬁned by the parameter φ. The domain is symmetrical with

respect to the magnetospheric equator. The three governing equations deﬁned in the

previous section are implemented in the orthogonal dipole coordinates [Cummings

et al., 1969]:

L = r/sin2(θ), µ = cos(θ)/r2, φ = φ.

(2.32)

Where r is the distance to the center of Earth that is normalized by RE = 6371.2km and θ is the polar angle. The unit vector L is locally perpendicular to the magnetic

28

shell and is in the ,x axis; and L has a constant value along a magnetic ﬁeld line. The unit vector µ is parallel to the local magnetic ﬁeld, z axis, and µ has a constant value along a line that is perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld line. The unit vector φ is locally eastward (y axis) and is perpendicular to the meridian lines and φ measures a longitudinal angle. This setup takes into account the dipole geometry of the background magnetic ﬁeld. The domain is illustrated in Figure 2.1.
Two dimensional computations are performed in the two-dimensional, axisymmetric (∂/∂φ = 0) domain consisting from two parts. One part is the dipole magnetic ﬂux tube that extends from the ionosphere to the equatorial plane and the second part is a cylindrical extension attached to the dipole part in the equatorial plane.
29

Figure 2.2: (Top.) The dipole part of the computational domain starting at 120 km altitude and ending at the equator. (Bottom.) The zoomed view of the part of the computational domain near the ionosphere. Only every 2nd parallel grid line is plotted in the ﬁgure.
It has a length of 30.3 RE and it is used as a “buﬀer” zone where the wave can propagate before/after it interacts with the ionosphere. The entire domain represents adequately extended in the magnetotail auroral ﬂux tube in the night side magnetosphere. Simulations that require three-dimensions are implemented in a fully dipolar domain.
The computational grid in the dipole part of the domain has 101 steps in the L direction, 64 steps in the φ direction, and 101 steps in the µ direction. The grid is uniform in the L and φ directions, and is strongly nonuniform in the µ direction.
30

For example, when the distance between the adjacent nodes in the direction along B0 is decreased by a factor of 50 from the equator to the ionosphere, the resulting grid is denser at low altitudes (grid size is 24 km) and is sparser in the equatorial magnetosphere (grid size is 1200 km). This approach allows the model resolve the spatio-temporal properties of the IFI interaction with the FACs in the ionospheric region. Figure 2.2 shows the two-dimensional view of the domain and the zoomed-in view of the ionospheric border of the domain.
2.4 Boundary Conditions
Boundary conditions play a very important role in the model. The ionospheric feedback instability is implemented through the usage of the BCs. The active ionospheric boundary conditions act as drivers and trigger the instability with a little perturbation, heating eﬀect or with other driver conﬁgurations. These active ionospheric BCs are integrated with the magnetospheric model through the current continuity and density continuity equations.
The ionospheric boundary of the domain is set at an altitude of 120 km. At this altitude FACs change the ionospheric density in the conducting E-region of the ionosphere and the modiﬁed conductivity changes the dynamics of the FACs in return [Trakhtengerts and Feldstein, 1991; Lysak , 1991; Pokhotelov et al., 2000; Streltsov , 2011; Jia and Streltsov , 2014]. On the poleward-equatorward parts of the domain Dirichlet boundary conditions are implemented. Periodic BCs are set for azimuthal boundaries of the domain. Figure 2.3 schematically shows the BCs that are implemented in the model.
31

Figure 2.3: Schematic view of the boundary conditions (BC) implemented in the model. Both ionospheres have active boundary conditions. Periodic boundary conditions are applied on the E-W boundaries. Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied on the poleward-equatorward sides of the domain.
The current continuity in a general form is

∇ · j = 0.

(2.33)

The simpliﬁcation of treating the ionosphere as a conducting thin slab is justiﬁed by the results of study performed by Lysak [1991]. It was shown that the ionospheric current can be integrated by height, with an assumption that there is no current ﬂowing between the ionosphere and neutral atmosphere. With this assumption, the current continuity equation can be modiﬁed as

32

∇⊥ · j⊥ = ±j .

(2.34)

This can be visualized as a ﬁeld-aligned current ﬂowing into the ionosphere, then

ﬂowing perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld (as height integrated current j⊥), and then leaving the ionosphere along a diﬀerent ﬁeld line. The sign “+” is used in the

Southern Hemisphere, and the sign “−” is used in the Northern Hemisphere. The

motion of ions and electrons in the ionosphere is aﬀected by neutrals. Ohm’s Law

give the following

J⊥

=

σP E⊥

−

σH

(2.35)

In this equation σP is the Pedersen conductivity and the ﬁrst term is the Pedersen current that is oriented along the perpendicular component of the background electric

ﬁeld. The second term is the Hall current term: it ﬂows in the E × B direction which

is at an angle to the Pedersen current. σH is the Hall conductivity. The relationship between the plasma conductivity and collisions with the neutrals was investigated by

Kelley [1989]:

σP =

(2.36)

σH = −

(2.37)

In which n, q, m, and f deﬁne density, charge, mass, and neutral particle collision

frequency, respectively, for each species s which have a gyrofrequency of ωcs. By integrating these plasma conductivities, the height integrated versions of them are

obtained:

0
ΣP = σP dz = neMP h,
−h

(2.38)

33

0
ΣH = σH dz = neMH h.
−h

(2.39)

Here, h = 20 km is the eﬀective thickness of the E-region, MP = 104 m2/sV is the ion

Pedersen mobility, and MH is ion Hall mobility. The MH parameter is proportional

to the MP [Brekke et al., 1974]. In the model used in this study, the expression ΣP =

MP nEhe/ cos λ accounts for the tilt angle, λ, between the normal to the ionosphere

and the central L-shell (average of the L1 and L2). By plugging back these expressions

into the Eq.2.34, the following expression of the current continuity is obtained

∇⊥ · (ΣP ∇⊥Φ) − b · ∇⊥ΣH × ∇⊥Φ − ∇⊥ΣH · (b × ∇⊥Φ) = ±j .

(2.40)

The eﬀect of the displacement current, 0∂E/∂t, is negligible in the ULF frequency range. So is the eﬀect of the third term in the last equation as was shown in the study of Kelley [1989]. This reduces the current continuity to

∇⊥ · (ΣP ∇⊥Φ) − b · ∇⊥ΣH × ∇⊥Φ = ±j .

(2.41)

Using the scaling factors introduced previously, the current continuity in the ionosphere can be expressed mathematically as

The other active boundary condition in the ionosphere is the density continuity

34

equation, in the form that was introduced by Sato [1978]:

∂n ∂t

=

+ α(n02

−

n2).

(2.43)

Where, n0 is the initial unperturbed height-integrated plasma density, α = 3 × 107 cm3/s is the recombination rate showing the rate at which ions and electrons produce neutrals in the ionosphere. It was shown in a study by Sato [1978] that α controls the growth rate of the IFI generated structures.

2.5 Background Parameters

The numerical model uses a dipolar background geomagnetic ﬁeld model which has

a form of

B0

=

B∗

RE 3 r3

(1 + 3 sin2 θ) nT

(2.44)

Here B∗ = 31000 nT, r is the geocentric distance measured in RE = 6371.2 km. One of the most important parameters of the model is the initial plasma density
distribution. It is modeled as

n0(L, µ, φ) = n01(L)n02(µ)n03(φ).

(2.45)

Here n01(L) provides density distribution proﬁle in the equatorward-poleward direction (L); n02(µ) gives the background plasma density proﬁle along the central magnetic ﬁeld line; and n03(φ) deﬁnes the plasma structure in the azimuthal direction. Density cavities deﬁned by these functions were observed by FAST satellite at altitudes above 1000 km [Chaston et al., 2002].
35

Plasma density proﬁle along the B is crucial for the conﬁnement of the IFI generated ULF waves in the IAR. The sharp gradient in the Alfv´en speed is modeled through the density along the magnetic ﬁeld. The following relationship describes the background density along the central magnetic ﬁeld line



 

a1(r − r1) + a2,

n02 =

 

b1e−20(r−r2)

+ b2r−4

+ b3,

if r1 < r < r2 if r > r2.

(2.46)

Where r is the radial distance to the grid point, r1 = 1 + 120/RE, and r2 = 1 + 320/RE. The constants a1, a2, b1, b2, and b3 are chosen to provide some speciﬁc values of the plasma density at the ionospheric E region (altitude of 120 km), F region (altitude of 320 km) and at the equatorial magnetosphere. Simulations show that the density in the ionospheric E and F regions are one of the main parameters of the model and the density in the equatorial magnetosphere is not so important for the development of the IFI inside the IAR. This value controls the value of the eigenfrequency of ULF waves in the global resonator. However, due to the high Alfv´en speeds near the equator variation of the plasma density in that region does not aﬀect results signiﬁcantly.
In the model, the ionospheric density deﬁnes the structure of the ambient electric ﬁeld of the entire numerical domain [Streltsov et al., 2005, 2012]. In a case of a current-free equilibrium, structure of the ambient background electric ﬁeld, E0⊥, is deﬁned by the ionospheric density. Due to the assumption that there is no constant parallel electric ﬁeld present in the magnetosphere, the ionospheric electric ﬁeld is mapped equipotentially along the background magnetic ﬁeld in the magnetosphere.
Low-orbit satellites frequently observe density cavities in the vicinity of the bright

36

discrete auroral arcs [Aikio et al., 2004]. Numerical studies have investigated the formation of these cavities [Streltsov and Karlsson, 2008]. The results suggest that the ponderomotive force, associated with the large-amplitude small-scale Alfv´e waves, is responsible for the formation of these cavities. The variation of the ionospheric density is modeled by n01(L) and n03(φ):

n01(L)

κ

cos

2π(L − L0) , L2 − L1

(2.47)

and

n03(φ) = 1 − βe−γ2r2.

Here κ deﬁnes the ratio between the density at the bottom of the cavity to the value at the edge of it. Value κ = 1 would indicate a homogeneous plasma distribution in the ionosphere. The size of the cavity is controlled by the parameters L1 and L2. Azimuthal variation of the plasma density is deﬁned by parameters β and γ which control range and amplitude of the distribution, respectively.

2.6 Numerical Algorithms

Partial diﬀerential equations that are present in the model are solved using a “predictor-

corrector” approach to advance the solution in time. A third-order Adams-Bashforth

(AB) method is used as a “predictor”, while the third-order Adams-Moulton (AM)

method is used as a “corrector” [Burden and Faires, 1991]. The usage of this ap-

proach improves the accuracy and makes computations more eﬃcient. At each time

step predictor (AB) part of the algorithm calculates the new value of A inside the

magnetosphere. Using this new value in the corrector (AM) part, Φ and n are up-

dated.

The spatial derivatives are approximated using a centered ﬁnite-diﬀerence ap-

proach. This is due to the fact that the numerical domain is rectangular in geometry.

Φ, n and A values are located on nodes that are shifted by a half-step to allow a

better resolution without increasing computational costs. Φ and n grid points are

split evenly along the µ direction making 101 nodes along each magnetic ﬁeld line

and have end-nodes on both ionospheres. At the same time, A has its points on

a grid that is located in-between of the Φ and n grid-points, making a total of 100

nodes along a magnetic ﬁeld line. All of them share the same grid system in L and φ

directions.

Two Laplacians, ∇2⊥A and ∇·

for Φ and A at each time step. This is implemented by using a discrete Fourier

transform in the azimuthal direction. The tridiagonal matrices that are formed in this

operation are solved eﬃciently using a Thomas algorithm [Golub and Loan, 1996].

Depending on the model input parameters, the matrix may lose its diagonal dominance in a case when the right-hand side of the last expression becomes larger than the left-hand side. This may happen when ΣH becomes larger than ΣP . In order to account for that, the model implements a PETSc package to solve the current continuity equation in the ionosphere. This package contains a GMRES numerical technique that uses the MPI routines to speedup the solving algorithm [Balay et al., 1997]. This PETSc package is implemented on the VEGA cluster and the model is adapted to run on its processors eﬃciently.

Chapter 3
2D Model: Modeling of MICA Sounding Rocket Observations
Results presented in this chapter are published in the Journal of Geophysical Research [Tulegenov and Streltsov, (2017), Ionospheric Alfv´en resonator and aurora: Modeling of MICA observations, 122, 7530, doi:10.1002/2017JA024181].
3.1 Introduction
Origin and dynamics of small-scale, intense electromagnetic waves with frequencies less than 1 Hz measured, by satellites and sounding rockets in the low-altitude magnetosphere and ionosphere, are questions under investigation in this chapter. The interest in these waves is motivated by their very important role in the electromagnetic coupling between the ionosphere and magnetosphere, particularly, in the highlatitude, auroral region. Among three modes of ultra-low-frequency (ULF) MHD waves, fast or compressible, intermediate or Alfv´en, and slow, the small-scale Alfv´en
40

waves are one of the most interesting from the point of view of the magnetosphereionosphere coupling. They carry magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents and ﬂuxes of the electromagnetic energy from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere. This plays an important role in the exchange of mass, momentum and energy between the ionosphere and magnetosphere at high latitudes. In particular, these waves are responsible for the parallel electron acceleration [Chaston et al., 2002], the heating of the ionosphere, the outﬂow of the ionospheric ions, and the formation of density disturbances in the ionospheric and magnetospheric plasmas.
A large number of observations performed on the ground [Aikio et al., 2004], through low-orbiting satellites [Karlsson and Marklund , 1996; Marklund et al., 1997; Rother et al., 2007], and sounding rockets [Cohen et al., 2013] demonstrate that the small-scale, very intense ULF waves are frequently observed in the vicinity of bright, discrete auroral arcs. This feature suggest that they are associated with a system of magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents causing auroras. Some studies suggest that these waves are generated by the magnetic ﬁeld line resonance. This involves coupling between fast MHD waves and shear Alfv´en waves in the equatorial magnetosphere and the formation of the standing pattern of the resonant Alfv´en waves between the magnetically conjugate locations in the ionosphere. Other studies suggest that these waves are the result of the phase mixing of shear waves traveling towards the ionosphere from the magnetotail.
Currently one of the most promising hypotheses explaining origin of these waves is the ionospheric feedback instability (IFI) introduced by Atkinson [1970]. It occurs when the magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents (FACs) change the conductivity in the ionosphere by precipitating or removing electrons from it, causing the variations in the
41

conductivity to positively “feed back” on the structure and amplitude of the original FACs, increasing their magnitude. This mechanism had been extensively studied during last 40 years and these studies show that the favorable conditions for the IFI development include the low ionospheric conductivity and the large perpendicular electric ﬁeld in the ionosphere [Sato, 1978; Lysak and Song, 2002]. Such conditions occur in the regions where downward FACs interact with the conducting E region of the ionosphere [Doe et al., 1995; Streltsov and Lotko, 2004; Paschmann et al., 2012].
Qualitatively, the feedback mechanism inside the IAR can be explained in terms of the “over reﬂection” of small-scale Alfv´en waves in the presence of a large-scale electric ﬁeld in the ionosphere [Trakhtengertz and Feldstein, 1984; Trakhtengerts and Feldstein, 1991; Pokhotelov et al., 2001; Lysak and Song, 2002]. Over reﬂection means that the amplitude of the Alfv´en wave reﬂected from ionosphere may be larger than the amplitude of the incident wave. That may occur when the ﬁeld-aligned current in the small-scale wave enhances locally the ionospheric conductivity and thus reduces the Joule dissipation of the large-scale electric ﬁeld in this location. The ﬁeld energy is then released in the form of the magnetic ﬁeld-aligned current propagating from the ionosphere and this contribution of this “additional” current makes the magnitude of the reﬂected current greater than the magnitude of the incident one. Therefore, multiple interactions of the same wave with the active ionosphere may lead to the increase of the wave amplitude.
To get several reﬂections from the ionosphere, the waves need to be trapped inside the resonator cavity in the magnetosphere with at least one of its boundaries sitting on the ionosphere. One such resonator is the ionospheric Alfv´en resonator (IAR), which is a region in the low-altitude magnetosphere bounded by the conducting bottom of
42

the ionosphere (ionospheric E-region) and the strong gradient in the Alfv´en speed at about 1 Re altitude [Polyakov and Rapoport, 1981]. It has eigenfrequencies between 0.1 Hz and 1 Hz [Trakhtengerts and Feldstein, 1987; Lysak , 1991; Pokhotelov et al., 2000; Hiraki and Watanabe, 2011].
Generation of small-scale, intense shear Alfv´en waves inside the IAR in the largescale downward FAC adjacent to the upward FAC associated with the bright discrete auroral arc had been investigated numerically by Streltsov and Lotko [2004, 2008]; Streltsov [2011]. These studies made several quantitative predictions about the generation mechanism and spatiotemporal properties of these waves. To verify these predictions it was proposed to perform in situ measurements of the ﬁelds and particles in the vicinity of the discrete aurora by using a sounding rocket launched into the aurora to compare the experimental results with predictions from the numerical model developed by Streltsov and Lotko [2008]. Such a rocket experiment, called Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling in the Alfv´en Resonator (MICA), took place on 19 February 2012. This chapter presents results from the numerical simulations, conﬁrming that the MICA rocket indeed detected small-scale, intense shear Alfv´en waves generated by the IFI inside IAR. Parameters and location of these waves are in good, quantitative agreement with the ones predicted by the numerical model [Streltsov and Lotko, 2008].
3.2 MICA Data
The Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling in the Alfv´en Resonator sounding rocket was launched on 19 February 2012 05:41:06 UT from the Poker Flat Research Range,

Alaska during active geomagnetic conditions. It reaches the apogee of 325.4 km after 297 seconds from the launch. The goal of the experiment was to measure parameters of the plasma and the electromagnetic ﬁeld inside, or very close to, the bright discrete auroral arc. The payload, parameters of the ﬂight, and geophysical conditions during the ﬂight are described in detail in several recent papers [e.g., Zettergren et al., 2014; Lynch et al., 2015; Fernandes et al., 2016; Fisher et al., 2016]. The discussion of the experimental data is limited to only those which are directly relevant to the modeling eﬀorts. In particular, all the experimental data used in this chapter are taken from Lynch et al. [2015].
During the ﬂight the rocket went close to the discrete auroral arc (arc A) and then passed through another arc (arc B). Figure 3.1 shows the keogram from the Venetie camera of MICA’s progression through the arcs. Figure 3.2 shows an overview of the data measured by MICA. The electric ﬁeld measurements were recorded from the Cornell University subpayload [Lundberg et al., 2012a,b]. The in-situ electron density measurements were obtained from the Norwegian multineedle Langmuir probe
44

(mNLP) [Moen et al., 2012]. The optical observations were obtained from the mediumﬁeld camera at Venetie. The magnetic ﬁeld measurement were recorded using Billingsley ﬂuxgate magnetometer (Billingsley TFM100G2).
The rocket passes close to arc A during the interval between 205 and 245 seconds from the launch. It then goes through arc B between 280 and 330 seconds as is seen in the visible auroral intensity at Venetie footprint in Figure 3.2 (fourth panel). After 330 seconds, the auroral activity shows a signiﬁcant drop. The DC electric ﬁeld components are shown in the ﬁrst panel in the geomagnetic coordinate system. The second panel shows the DC magnetic ﬁeld components that are deﬂected from IGRF. The cross product of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld vectors in the form of Poynting ﬂux is shown in the third panel. In the coordinate system used for the MICA data, the cross product of north and east is positive down. This means that magnetic ﬁeld, Poynting ﬂux and currents are positive pointing downward towards the earth. Comparison of the Poynting ﬂux shown in the third panel in Figure 3.2 and the auroral luminosity shown in the forth panel demonstrates that: 1) no intense small-scale waves were detected by MICA when the rocket ﬂew through the maximums of luminosity associated with arcs A and B; 2) intense small-scale electromagnetic structures had been observed near the edges of arcs A and B. The observed structures have periods of a few seconds, which suggests that these small-scale, large amplitude electromagnetic ﬂuctuations are Alfv´en waves trapped inside the IAR.
In this study the main focus is on the dynamics of small-scale FACs observed by the MICA rocket because they are the main participants of the magnetosphereionosphere interactions controlled by the IFI. The parallel current density is obtained as the curl of the measured magnetic ﬁeld [Lynch et al., 2015]. The results below

show the modeling of the small-scale, very intense FAC structures detected in the vicinity of both arcs.

The third panel shows the Poynting ﬂux calculated from E and B ﬁelds (positive is downward). The fourth panel shows the optical intensity measured by the medium-ﬁeld camera. And the ﬁfth panel shows the plasma density measured by the mNLP probe.

3.3 Numerical Implementation and Boundary Con-
ditions
Computations are performed in the two-dimensional, axisymmetric (∂/∂φ = 0) domain consisting from two parts. One part is the dipole magnetic ﬂux tube that extends from the ionosphere to the equatorial plane and the second part is a cylindrical extension attached to the dipole part in the equatorial plane. It has a length of 30.3 RE and it is used as a “buﬀer” zone where the wave can propagate before/after it interacts with the ionosphere. The entire domain represents an adequate extension of the auroral ﬂux tube in the night side magnetosphere.
In the model the background magnetic ﬁeld is directed from the ionosphere, as is the case in the southern hemisphere. In such a conﬁguration, the upward current which is pointed along the ﬁeld is positive and the downward current is negative.
Figure 3.3 shows the dipole part of the domain used in the simulation of the Arc B event: the lateral boundaries of the domain are set at L = 6.87 and L = 7.27 magnetic shells. Only every 2nd parallel grid line is plotted in the ﬁgure. Figure 3.3 also shows, with a red line, the MICA rocket trajectory mapped into the computational domain using the 11th generation of the IGRF model [Finlay et al., 2010].
In this study, ﬁelds and currents calculated by the model are compared with the corresponding quantities measured by the MICA rocket. The numerical data is interpolated on the trajectory of the virtual rocket “ﬂying” through the computational domain with the velocity, along the trajectory, matching the corresponding parameters of the real rocket. This interpolation will be done both in time and space in order to match the time and location of the data obtained by the MICA rocket.

(3.1)

Here r is the radial distance to the grid point where r1 = 1 + 120/RE, and r2 = 1 + 320/RE. The constants a1, a2, b1, b2, and b3 are chosen to provide some speciﬁc values of the plasma density at the ionospheric E region (altitude of 120 km),

48

F region (altitude of 320 km) and at the equatorial magnetosphere. Values of the coeﬃcients in Eq. 3.1 were chosen from several test runs of simu-
lations with the goal to reproduce dynamics, spatial structure and amplitude of the observed small-scale structures with the numerical results. For example, in the simulations of waves observed near the arc B, values of constants in Eq. 3.1 were chosen to provide nE = 5.0 × 104 cm−3, nF = 3.0 × 105 cm−3 and neq = 10 cm−3. These values are close to the density values observed by the MICA mNLP probe.
Simulations are started by specifying large-scale magnetic-ﬁeld aligned currents on the magnetospheric boundary of the domain. Structure and amplitude of the magnetospheric currents deﬁne the dynamics of the small-scale FACs observed in the vicinity of arc A and arc B by the MICA rocket. Because the structure, location and dynamics of these small-scale FACs are diﬀerent, the amplitude and structure of the large-scale magnetospheric currents driving IFI are diﬀerent as well.
For example, optical observations show that the MICA rocket traversed arc B but did not traverse arc A. It only “touched” it near the edge, and to model the MICA rocket ﬂight near the arc A, a full 3D model is needed. To model this passage of the rocket through the arc the 2D model is used and it is assumed that the rocket went through arc A. The MICA observations performed in the vicinity of arc A are modeled using a system of two downward and one upward FACs deﬁned at the equatorial boundary of the domain as

of the domain, and jA(t) linearly increases from 0 to 120 nA/m2 during the ﬁrst 19 seconds of simulations, then remaining constant after that. This linear “ramp-phase” provides a gradual increase in the amplitude of the wave propagating from the equator toward the ionosphere.

3.4 Results and Discussions
From the modelling studies of interactions between the system of large-scale magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents and the high-latitude ionosphere performed by Streltsov and Lotko [2004, 2008] and Streltsov and Karlsson [2008], it is known that the intense, small-scale structures ﬁrst appear at the boundary between the upward and downward currents and propagate into the downward current channel. These dynamics are explained by the fact that these structures are generated by the strong gradients in the ionospheric plasma density caused by the precipitation/removal of electrons by FACs, and they propagate in the direction of the perpendicular electric ﬁeld induced by the large-scale currents in the ionosphere. This ﬁeld moves the ionospheric ions

50

across the magnetic ﬁeld from the location where the electrons are removed by the downward FAC to the location where they are precipitated by the upward FAC. Therefore, the intense, small-scale currents produced by the IFI are expected to be observed in the downward current channels adjacent to the upward current channel associated with the strong electron precipitation causing discrete auroral arcs.
In application to the small-scale structures observed near arc A and arc B, this simple physical picture of the development of the ionospheric feedback instability provides some insight on the structure of large-scale currents driven the instability. In particular, the small-scale structures have been observed on both edges of arc A and only on one edge of arc B. These features suggest that the small-scale currents observed near arc A are the result of interactions between the ionosphere with the system of two large-scale downward and one upward FACs (given by Eq. 3.2) and the small-scale waves observed near the B, which are the result of interactions between the ionosphere and one downward and one upward FACs (given by Eq. 3.3).
Numerical results of modeling small-scale structures observed near arc B is done ﬁrst. Figure 3.4 shows six snapshots of j obtained from the simulations at time t = 370, 400, 430, 480, 530, and 580 s. Trajectory of the MICA rocket is plotted in each panel for reference. These snapshots show that the pair of upward and downward currents with an amplitude of 9 µA/m2 reach the ionosphere from the magnetospheric boundary at t = 370 s. The currents increase in amplitude in the next 8-10 s and the ionospheric feedback instability starts to produce small scale currents at the boundary between the two large-scale FACs. The instability starts to grow in size and propagate along the downward current region. At time t = 390 s the amplitudes of small-scale currents start to saturate at the value of 273 µA/m2. Panels corresponding to t = 480,
51

530, and 580 s illustrate how the small-scale structures “populate” the downward current channel as time proceeds.
Figure 3.5 shows a snapshot of j from the same simulation taken at t = 600 s at the entire dipole part of the domain: from the ionosphere to the altitude (or the length along the L = 7.07 magnetic ﬁeld line) of 5×104 km. The proﬁle of the Alfv´en speed is shown in the ﬁgure with a solid black line. The ﬁgure conﬁrms that the small-scale currents are indeed trapped between the ionosphere and the sharp gradient in the Alfv´en speed, which provides the upper boundary of the ionospheric Alfv´en resonator.
The linear theory postulates that the ionospheric feedback instability occurs when udk⊥ > ω, where ud = MP E⊥ is the ion drift velocity in the ionosphere, k⊥ is the perpendicular wavenumber, and ω is the angular wave frequency [Trakhtengertz and Feldstein, 1984; Trakhtengerts and Feldstein, 1991; Lysak and Song, 2002]. In the simulations illustrated in Figure 3.4 these parameters at t = 400 s are k⊥ = 2π/2.25×10−3 m−1, E⊥ = 128 mV/m, and ω = 2π0.39 s−1. Once these parameters are plugged into the threshold inequality, it can be noticed that the necessary condition is satisﬁed with 128 mV/m > 87.7 mV/m.
The ionospheric feedback instability in the ionospheric Alfv´en resonator also can be characterized by the growth rate. An analytical expression for the linear growth rate γ is derived by Lysak [1991] and Pokhotelov et al. [2000, 2001] as γL = αP η1m/2, where αP = ΣP µ0VAI, VAI = 1214km/s is the Alfv´en speed in the resonator, and η1m is the root of J1(η) = 0. The ﬁrst three roots of J1(η) are 0, 3.8, and 7. At time t = 400s γsimulation = 1.58, and ΣP = 0.383 mho gives a γL = 1.43. This conﬁrms that the ionospheric feedback instability generates small-scale structures inside the

IAR. To make a quantitative, detailed, comparison between numerical results and the MICA observations, the simulated data had been interpolated in space and in time onto the rocket trajectory mapped onto the computational domain. In other word, a “virtual” MICA rocket had been launched into the simulation domain with the parameters (velocity and location) matching the parameters of the real rocket. Figure 3.6 shows the comparison between the ﬁne-scale density of FACs calculated from the curl of the MICA magnetic ﬁeld data [Lynch et al., 2015] and the parallel current density measured by the virtual MICA “ﬂying” through the simulations. The pink box in this ﬁgure marks the location/time of arc B. The ﬁne-scale MICA current density measurements have a moving window average width of 1.6 s.
To make the comparison between the numerical results and the observations more quantitative, the power spectral density (PSD) of the parallel current density is cal-

culated for both the model and experimental output. The current is obtained from the magnetic ﬁeld detected by the MICA rocket and from the magnetic ﬁeld obtained in the simulations. These PSDs are shown in the right panel in Figure 3.7. It shows that most of the power in the simulated signal is in the frequency range from 0.30 Hz to 0.45 Hz, which are typical values for the eigenfrequencies of IAR at high latitudes

[e.g. Streltsov and Lotko, 2008]. It should be mentioned here that the model produces and maintains stable, intense, small-scale current structures inside the IAR through 800 s of simulation.
MICA signal has most of its power in the frequency range from 0.18 Hz to 0.50 Hz and the peak of PSD of MICA data matches the peak in PSD of simulated data at 0.38 Hz. The fact that the PSD of the MICA data is broader than PSD of the simulated currents is quite normal, because the MICA signal contains contributions from many diﬀerent physical processes occurring in the real space environment which are not included in the reduced MHD model implemented here. To make a better comparison between measured and simulated currents, both signals shown in Figure 3.6 had been ﬁltered by the bandpass ﬁlter in the frequency range from 0.25 Hz to 0.60 Hz (This interval is marked in the left frame in Figure 3.7 with the gray rectangle). The right panel in Figure 3.7 shows the ﬁltered MICA signal with a red, dashed line and the ﬁltered signal from the simulation with a solid black line. Comparison
56

between two plots shown in the right panel in Figure 3.7 conﬁrms that the physical model presented in this paper produces a reasonable agreement in spatial structure, dynamics and amplitude between the numerical results and MICA data related to arc B.
Simulations had also been performed with the goal to model small-scale currents observed by MICA near arc A. The main diﬀerence between these structures and the ones observed near arc B is that they occur on both edges of the upward current channel associated with the arc. In this case the system of two downward and one upward currents given by Eq. 3.3 had been used to drive the instability. The two downward channels can be easily recognized in the observations by the presence of intense small-scale current structures in them. The amplitude and the spatial sizes of the driver and the computational domain are given previously in this chapter. The virtual rocket had been ﬂown through the simulations along the trajectory of the real rocket mapped into the simulation domain. The simulated parallel current density had been compared with the parallel current density calculated from MICA data that was obtained by Lynch et al. [2015]. One of the main parameters aﬀecting this comparison is the moment of time when the virtual rocket was “launched” into the simulation.
The best case comparison between the numerical results and observations related to arc A is shown in Figure 3.8. There, the simulated parallel current density is shown with the solid black line and the one obtained from the observations is shown with a dashed red line. Both signals had been ﬁltered with the bandpass ﬁlter in a frequency range from 0.20 Hz to 0.70 Hz. Figure 3.8 again demonstrates a good, quantitative agreement between the numerical results and the results derived from the observa-

tions. After a good quantitative agreement between measured and simulated current densities has been achieved, a comparison between the electric and magnetic ﬁelds is done next. The top panel in Figure 3.9 shows the two components of the measured electric ﬁeld and the perpendicular component of electric ﬁeld from the simulation. The bottom panel shows the two components of the measured magnetic ﬁeld and the perpendicular component of magnetic ﬁeld from the simulation. The same bandpass ﬁlter had been applied to the model output. Qualitatively, the observed and the simulated ﬁelds are in a good agreement with each other, although they are not identical. One of the main reasons for the diﬀerences between measured and simulated results is that the measurements had been performed on the spinning payload ﬂying through the 3D structures. So the electric and the magnetic ﬁelds detected by MICA have
58

two perpendicular components. The simulated ﬁelds have only one perpendicular component because they are obtained from the 2D model. Obviously, this fact will lead to the diﬀerence between how these ﬁelds obtained in simulations and measured on the rocket should look like in the time domain. However, the spectral properties of these ﬁelds (frequencies and wave numbers) will be close to each other, as it was demonstrated in the case of the parallel current density.
3.5 Chapter Conclusion
The results from the modeling study of small-scale, intense current structures observed by the MICA sounding rocket in the close vicinity of discrete auroral arcs are presented in this chapter and in the associated paper Tulegenov and Streltsov [2017]. The goal of this study was to verify the hypothesis given by Streltsov and Lotko [2008], that the small-scale large amplitude structures can be generated by the ionospheric feedback instability driven by a system of large-scale magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents interacting with the ionosphere. This hypothesis also predicts that the small-scale current structures should be observed on the boundaries between upward and downward currents and inside populate the downward current channels adjacent to the bright discrete auroral arcs.
Simulations of the reduced 2D MHD model derived in the dipole magnetic ﬁeld geometry with the background parameters matching the MICA sounding rocket in-situ observations conﬁrm this hypothesis. In particular, results from simulations reproduce spatial structure, frequency, and amplitude of the small-scale, intense magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents observed by MICA rocket at the edges of two bright, discrete

Simulations also demonstrate that the important condition for the existence of a

of these currents inside the ionospheric Alfv´en resonator. Parameters of the plasma inside the resonator (in particular, the magnitude of the plasma density inside the ionospheric E and F regions) together with the amplitude of the large-scale currents producing the aurora and driving the instability deﬁne spatiotemporal features of small-scale currents. In conclusion, simulations presented in this chapter conﬁrm that the MICA project achieved the scientiﬁc goals formulated in their proposal. It is a signiﬁcant contribution in the experimental veriﬁcation of the importance of the ionospheric feedback instability for the generation of large-amplitude small-scale structures inside the ionospheric Alfv´en resonator in the auroral zone.

3D Model: Artiﬁcial Aurora
Results presented in this chapter are published in the Journal of Geophysical Research [Tulegenov et al., (2019), Artiﬁcial aurora produced by HAARP, 124, doi:10.1029/2019JA026607].
4.1 Introduction
Experiments involving ionospheric heating with high-frequency (HF) electromagnetic waves have been conducted on several heating facilities in Europe, Russia, and the USA for more than 60 years. They demonstrate many interesting linear and nonlinear eﬀects observed on the ground, in the ionosphere, and in the magnetosphere of the Earth. Comprehensive reviews of these experiments and their results are given by Gurevich [2007] and Streltsov et al. [2018].
One particular direction of these experiments is a generation of artiﬁcial luminous structures in the ionosphere. Actually, the creation of an artiﬁcial luminosity was the main goal of one of the ﬁrst heating facilities constructed in the Soviet Union
62

in 1961 [Gurevich, 2007]. A comprehensive review of early experiments focusing on an excitation of optical emissions at the EISCAT and HAARP facilities is given by Kosch et al. [2007].
In general, the heating can be conducted with O-mode or X-mode waves. The more frequently used is the O-mode heating. Usually, the frequency of the O-mode pump-wave is chosen close to the maximum frequency of the F2 ionospheric region, and the electrons in this region are energized via an anomalous absorption mechanism. This is a “local” heating, and all the eﬀects observed in this case are produced by the increase in the electron temperature at this altitude. This heating can create various luminous structures (in particular, rings and solid spots) [Bernhardt et al., 1988, 1989; Pedersen et al., 2009] and artiﬁcial ionization layers, which have been studied by Mishin et al. [2004, 2005, 2016]; Kosch et al. [2005]; Pedersen et al. [2010].
Another approach to the ionospheric modiﬁcation is the heating with X-mode HF waves. The X-mode HF waves can interact with the electrons through the cyclotron resonance, and this heating is used to change the temperature of the bulk population of electrons in the ionospheric D and E regions. The variations in the electron temperature change the Hall and Pedersen conductances in the ionosphere. And if there is an electric ﬁeld in the ionosphere, then the changes in the conductances cause changes in the Hall and Pedersen currents ﬂowing in the ionosphere, which, in turn, generate magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents (FACs) ﬂowing into the magnetosphere. This is a so-called Getmantsev’s eﬀect [Getmantsev et al., 1974], which was introduced in 1974 and extensively used after that for the generation of ULF and VLF waves in the high-latitude ionosphere-magnetosphere system. The auroral and subauroral zones are particularly favorable for this mechanism because, normally, there is a large-
63

scale electric ﬁeld in the ionosphere associated with the electrojet [Gurevich, 2011; Stubbe and Kopka, 1977; Stubbe et al., 1981; Robinson et al., 1998]. The injection of ELF/VLF waves into the magnetosphere via modulated heating of the electrojet by HAARP has been extensively studied by Papadopoulos et al. [2003], Golkowski et al. [2008]; Golkowski et al. [2011], and Cohen et al. [2010].
If the frequency of the ULF wave generated with heating matches one of the eigenfrequencies of the global magnetospheric resonator, then this wave can form a standing pattern along the magnetic ﬁeld line between the conjugate hemispheres. In this case, a large-amplitude ULF wave can be generated by a relatively small ionospheric disturbance modulated with the eigenfrequency of the resonator e.g., [Streltsov et al., 2005]. The large-amplitude ULF Alfv´en waves may have a parallel electric ﬁeld due to kinetic or inertial wave dispersion [Hasegawa, 1976; Goertz and Boswell , 1979], anomalous resistivity [Mozer , 2011], plasma turbulence [Jasperse et al., 2010], mirror force [Nakamura, 2000], etc. This electric ﬁeld can accelerate electrons along an ambient magnetic ﬁeld into the ionosphere and cause bright, discrete auroral forms. The causal connection between magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents carried by shear Alfv´en waves and natural luminous auroral structures has been convincingly demonstrated in many studies reviewed by Stasiewicz et al. [2000]. At the same time, there are still not many successful experiments reported in the literature, where the heating of the ionosphere with X-mode waves simultaneously produces disturbances in the magnetic ﬁeld and the artiﬁcial airglow. This study reproduces with 3D MHD simulations results from one of the ﬁrst successful experiments devoted to this problem.

4.2 The HAARP Heating Experiment
The experiment was conducted at HAARP on March 12, 2013 from 06:45 to 08:00 UT (corresponding to March 11, 2013, 22:45-24:00 Alaskan Daylight Time). During the experiment, HAARP transmitted X-mode electromagnetic waves with a frequency of 4.57 MHz in the direction of the local magnetic zenith (or in the direction of the ambient magnetic ﬁeld). It has been shown in many studies, e.g., [Rietveld et al., 2003; Honary et al., 2011; Streltsov et al., 2018], that heating in the magnetic zenith is the most eﬃcient for changing the electron temperature in the ionosphere. The size of the heated spot at the altitude of 120 km for the 3 dB beamwidth of 4.57 MHz vertical beam is ≈ 20km. The spot does not change its location during the entire experiment. The total power of the HAARP transmitter was 3.6 MW. The eﬀective radiated power (ERP) of the transmitter is 1023 MW for the 4.57 MHz wave. The change in the beam direction from vertical to the MZ (≈ 14.4◦ at HAARP magnetic latitude) may cause insigniﬁcant (≈ 3%) change in the size of the heating spot in the ionosphere and small variation in the ERP.
The HF signal has been modulated with a 0.9 mHz (556 s ON/OFF) frequency. This frequency was chosen from the observations of large-amplitude ULF waves detected with the ﬂuxgate magnetometer in Gakona, Alaska, during several experimental campaigns at HAARP in the years 2011-2013 [Guido et al., 2014]. These observations frequently demonstrate waves with frequencies of 0.75 mHz and 0.9 mHz during the periods of strong geomagnetic disturbances. These frequencies are at the low end of the so-called “magic” frequencies, sometimes attributed to shear Alfv´en waves standing inside the global magnetic ﬁeld resonator [Samson et al., 1992; Fenrich et al., 1995].
65

During the experiment, three components of the magnetic ﬁeld have been measured with the HAARP ﬂuxgate magnetometer in Gakona. The blue line in Figure 4.1a shows the D-component of the magnetic ﬁeld, measured by the ﬂuxgate magnetometer in Gakona on March 12, 2013 from 05:30 to 09:30 UT. The black line in Figure 4.1a shows the low-frequency (< 0.7 mHz) part of the signal, and Figure 4.1b shows the high frequency (> 0.7 mHz) part. The vertical red lines in Figures 4.1a and 4.1b mark the time of the beginning and the ending of the experiment. The time when the transmitter was ON is marked with pink boxes in Figure 4.1b.
Figure 4.1c shows the power spectral density (PSD) of the signal shown in Figure 4.1b in the frequency range from 0 to 5 mHz. Figure 4.1c shows that the main power of the signal is in the frequency of modulation 0.9 mHz, and Figure 4.1b shows very good correlation in phase and frequency between the periodicity of the heater’s ON/OFF intervals and the oscillations of the magnetic ﬁeld measured on the ground. The H-component of the magnetic ﬁeld measured by the magnetometer during this time interval also reveals oscillations with the frequency of 0.9 mHz (not shown in the paper). These results suggest that X-mode heating indeed generates ULF waves and magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents, as was previously suggested by Blagoveshchenskaya et al. [2001] and Streltsov et al. [2012].
Figure 4.2 shows three sets of 630.0 nm optical images taken during the experiment by the HAARP telescope. The telescope can take images in 427.8 nm, 557.7 nm, 630.0 nm, and 777.4 nm wavelengths. The ﬁrst set of images was taken during the time interval 06:45:00 - 06:54:15 UT, when the heater was ON. This set contains images with a bright luminous spot in the center. The second set of images was taken during time interval 06:54:15 - 07:03:31 UT, when the heater was turned OFF and no

luminosity was observed. The third set of images was taken during the time interval 07:03:31 - 07:12:46 UT, when the heater was ON, and this set again shows a luminous spot in the ionosphere. Thus, the observations with 630.0 nm ﬁlter demonstrate optical emissions during the ﬁrst two (out of total four) time intervals when the heater was ON. Observations with 557.7 nm ﬁlter demonstrate optical emissions during the same time intervals as well, although the structures of the emissions in 557.7 nm

wavelength are diﬀerent compared to the ones observed in 630.0 nm wavelength. For comparison, Figure 4.3 shows two high resolution images in 630.0 nm and 557.7 nm wavelengths at times 06:53:28 and 06:53:32 UT correspondingly. The main diﬀerence between these two images is that 630.0 nm luminosity is relatively smooth and 557.7 nm image is more “structured” as was observed previously by Pedersen et al. [2010].

4.3 Numerical Implementation and Boundary Conditions
The 3D MHD model described previously is used to investigate the proposed theory. The constant heating of the ionosphere by HAARP is modeled by solving the highly integrated density continuity equation with the reduced recombination in the northern ionosphere

∂n j = +α
∂t eh

(4.1)

H speciﬁes the heating. It is chosen as H = 0.5 e−(ρ/ρ0)2, where ρ is the distance in the ionosphere from the location of the maximum of the heater beam, and ρ0 = 10 km is a half-width of the beam. Experiments with HF X-mode heating have shown that the density can be enhanced by up to 70% relative to the background [Blagoveshchenskaya et al., 2015]. It is assumed that the heater modiﬁes the density by 20%, which is well within the reported values.
The model equations are written in the orthogonal dipole coordinates (L, φ, µ), where L = r sin2 θ, µ = cos θ/r2, and r, θ, and φ are standard spherical coordinates. Computations have been performed in the three-dimensional dipole magnetic ﬂux tube bounded by the ionosphere in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The latitudinal boundaries of the domain are formed by L = 4.75 and L = 5.05 magnetic shells. The azimuthal size of the domain is φ ≈ 1◦.
The magnitude of the large scale E⊥ is based on the digisonde drift velocities presented in Figure 4.4. Using the two components of the electron drift velocity we calculate the resultant E⊥. The amplitude of the electric ﬁeld during the ﬁrst two periods of the heating was peaking at 6.5 mV/m at 06:50 UT. After 07:15 UT, the magnitude of the large-scale E⊥ decreases and reaches a minimum of 2.85 mV/m at 07:45 UT.
The proﬁle of the background density along L = 4.90 magnetic ﬁeld line (corresponding to the location of HAARP) is deﬁned as:

(4.2)

Here r is the radial distance to point on the ﬁeld line, r1 = 1 + 120/Re, and

70

r2 = 1 + 320/Re. The constants a1, a2, b1, b2 and b3 are parameters that satisfy a density of 1.25 × 104 cm−3 at E region altitude of 120 km, 1.5 × 105 cm−3 at F region altitude of 320 km and 129 cm−3 in the equatorial magnetosphere.
One of the main parameters in the model is the density in the ionospheric E region. That density deﬁnes the conductivities of the ionosphere, which are supposed to be modiﬁed by the heating. Data from the HAARP digisonde, shown in Figure 4.5, demonstrate that this density is quite low. At the least, it is below the threshold which can be detected by the digisonde. Because the digisonde can detect densities starting from 1.25 × 104 cm−3 (corresponding to the plasma frequency of 1 MHz), it was decided to choose this value for the magnitude of the background density in the simulations. This value of the density provides ΣP = 0.4 mho.
4.4 Results and Discussion
The experiment conducted at HAARP on March 12, 2013, brings two equally important and interesting results. First, it demonstrates, for the ﬁrst time, that heating of the ionosphere with X-mode HF waves can generate bright luminous structures in 557.7, 630.0, and 777.4 nm wavelengths. On the other hand, there were no luminous structures observed in the 427.8 nm wavelength (higher energy blue line). Figure 4.2 shows three sets of optical images in 630.0 nm wavelength taken with the HAARP telescope during the experiments. It is worth mentioning here that normally, the airglow has been observed in the ionosphere above HAARP only during the O-mode heating [Kosch et al., 2005].
Of course, the X-mode heater transmissions always contain some level of contam-

inating O-mode polarization. However, the HAARP array controls and monitors the currents on each dipole independently and can maintain very high isolation between polarizations. In this case, the measured O-mode component was at least 25 dB below the X-mode level. Furthermore, the sequence of ionograms presented in Figure 4.5 shows that the highest frequency reﬂected by O-mode transmission, including the considerable frequency spread, was no greater than 4 MHz, well below the heating frequency of 4.57 MHz used in this experiment, while f xF 2 exceeded the heating frequency prior to 07:20 UT.
Second, the 03/12/2013 experiment generates oscillations in the magnetic ﬁeld with the frequency perfectly matching the frequency of heating modulations. These observations are shown in Figure 4.1b, which gave a strong reason to conclude that, during the experiment, HAARP indeed produces magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents ﬂowing into the magnetosphere. This conclusion is also supported by Streltsov and Pedersen [2011], who showed with 3D MHD simulations that some luminous structures (in particular, rings and solid spots) produced by HAARP in the O-heating experiments can be interpreted in terms of ULF waves and ﬁeld-aligned currents.
In this study, the next step is done in the development of the numerical model used by Streltsov and Pedersen [2011] by including the Hall conductivity in the ionosphere and using a more realistic heating mechanism. Namely, the model assumes that the heating decreases the recombination coeﬃcient in the ionospheric E region, and the decrease in the recombination increases the density. The model is simulated based on the geomagnetic conditions observed during the experiment, and the results of the simulations are shown in Figures 4.6 and 4.7.
Speciﬁcally, in the simulations, the heating changes the plasma density in the E
74

region in the Northern Hemisphere according to Eq.4.1. Modiﬁcation of the ionospheric density changes the conductivity, which generates ﬁeld-aligned currents, if the large-scale electric ﬁeld exists in the ionosphere according to the Eq.2.41. Figure 4.6 shows a snapshot of the ﬁeld aligned current density inside the 3D domain at the time t=158.5 s after the heating has begun. In full agreement with Streltsov and Pedersen [2011], the simulations demonstrate that such constant heating leads to a rapid formation of two ﬁeld-aligned currents that are closed through the ionosphere in both hemispheres. The structure of the currents obtained in the simulations is diﬀerent from the structure of currents shown by Streltsov and Pedersen [2011]. Namely, in the simulation runs performed for this study, the heating produces two current channels standing side-by-side, and in the simulations by Streltsov and Pedersen [2011], the currents form an axisymmetric structure. This diﬀerence is explained by the diﬀerent models for the heating used in these two studies.
The FAC ﬂows from the Southern to the Northern Hemisphere in one channel (shown with red in Figures 4.6 and 4.7) and ﬂows in the opposite direction along the adjacent channel (shown with blue). It is assumed that these FACs may cause some parallel electric ﬁeld in the current channels (due to the dispersive eﬀect, double layer formation, anomalous resistivity, or any other mechanisms that depend on the amplitude and the transverse size of FAC), which can accelerate electrons into the ionosphere and produce artiﬁcial aurora. Figure 4.7 shows snapshots of the parallel current density and the plasma density in the ionosphere at t = 158.5 s. Speciﬁcally, Figures 4.7a and 4.7c show plasma and current densities produced by the heating in the ionosphere with E⊥ = 6.5 mV/m, ΣP = 0.4 mho, and ΣH = 2 ΣP . Figures 4.7b and 4.7d show plasma and current densities produced by the heating in the

ionosphere with E⊥ = 6.5 mV/m, ΣP = 0.4 mho, and ΣH = 0 (no Hall current). The contour lines from Figures 4.7a and 4.7c are also shown in Figures 4.7b and 4.7d, to demonstrate relation between density enhancements produced by the heating and the structure and location of the corresponding ﬁeld-aligned currents.
Figure 4.7 demonstrates that there are two important eﬀects associated with adding a Hall conductivity into the model. First, the Hall conductivity increases the magnitude of the generated ﬁeld-aligned current by 50%. This result follows directly from the eq. 2.41. Second, the Hall conductivity rotates the FAC system around the center of the heating spot. This is in the agreement with Eq. 2.41 which states that
76

Figure 4.7: Panels a) and b) are snapshots of ionospheric density n from the numerical model at t=158.5 s under diﬀerent ionospheric conditions: a) with ΣH/ΣP =2 and b) with ΣH/ΣP =0. Panels c) and d) are the snapshots of ionospheric j at t=158.5 s with ΣH/ΣP =2 and ΣH/ΣP =0, respectively. The 3D simulations are performed with E⊥ = 6.5 mV/m. The contour lines from panels a) and c) are mapped to panels b) and d) correspondingly, to demonstrate the relation between density enhancements produced by the heating and the structure and location of the corresponding ﬁeldaligned currents. Adapted from Tulegenov et al. [2019].
FACs are generated in the direction of the resultant ionospheric conductivity [Jia and
Streltsov , 2014]. This happens because the ﬁeld-aligned current is closed through the
ionosphere by the combination of Pedersen and Hall currents. The Pedersen current
is parallel to the background electric ﬁeld, which is in the north-south direction in
77

the simulations, and the Hall current is perpendicular to it. Therefore, when the Hall conductivity is equal to zero, the ﬁeld aligned current is closed by the Pedersen current only, and this current is aligned with the electric ﬁeld in the direction from L = 4.75 to L = 5.05. When the Hall conductivity is two times larger than the Pedersen conductivity, FACs are closed in the ionosphere at some angle to the direction of the background electric ﬁeld.
Another interesting eﬀect observed in the simulations is that the maximum of the downward (red) and upward (blue) ﬁeld aligned currents do not coincide with the maximum of the density disturbances or the maximum of the heating power. This happens because the currents are formed by the gradients in (ΣP E⊥ + ΣHE⊥ × b) (see Eq. 2.41), and when the background electric ﬁeld is uniform, these gradients are produced by the density gradients only. Therefore, simulations predict that when the large-scale electric ﬁeld in the ionosphere is relatively uniform, the bright luminous spot produced by the heating should be observed not exactly where the heating has a maximum power, but in the close vicinity. The exact location and the orientation of the luminous structure relative to the heating spot and the orientation of the background electric ﬁeld depend on the relation between Pedersen and Hall conductivities. This conclusion is consistent with the observations which frequently show some oﬀset between the heating and the maximum of the luminosity in heating experiments [Pedersen et al., 2009; Grach et al., 2016].
78

4.5 Chapter Conclusion
The reasonable agreement between the observations and results of 3D simulations lead to the conclusion that the luminous spots and disturbances in the magnetic ﬁeld detected during the 03/12/2013 HAARP experiment may be related to the magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents produced by the heating of the ionosphere with the X-mode HF waves. It is also heavily emphasized that the complete physical model of the coupled and rapidly changing magnetosphere-ionosphere system during X- or O-mode heating is much more complicated and includes many physical eﬀects which are not taken into account in the current model. In particular, the model does not resolve the vertical structure of the ionospheric E region and does not include any electrochemistry of photo-ionization mechanism in the ionosphere. It also does not include any mechanisms producing the parallel electric ﬁeld in the ﬁeld-aligned currents in the magnetosphere, as well as the eﬀects of the electron precipitation in the upward currents on the ionospheric density. Therefore, more advanced and comprehensive models of the ionosphere-magnetosphere system are necessary to unambiguously explain the results from this particular experiment.
The generation of the ﬁeld-aligned currents by changing the ionospheric conductivity in the presence of the large-scale electric ﬁeld in the ionosphere is one of the most basic and robust results produced by the heating. And these ﬁeld-aligned currents will always contribute to the energization of the ionosphere by delivering Poynting and particle ﬂuxes into it. Hence, it is concluded that the mechanism, considered in this Chapter and in the associated paper Tulegenov et al. [2019], should always be taken into account, together with other (local ionospheric) mechanisms, in the experiments involving artiﬁcial modiﬁcation of the ionosphere (D and E regions).

Chapter 5
3D Model: Eﬃcient method of generating ULF/ELF waves
Results presented in this chapter are published in the Geophysical Research Letters [Tulegenov and Streltsov, (2019), Eﬀects of the Hall conductivity in ionospheric heating experiments, doi:10.1029/2019GL083340].
5.1 Introduction
Shear Alfv´en waves carrying magnetic ﬁeld-aligned currents (FACs) are one of the major participants in the redistribution of electromagnetic power, particle density, mass, and momentum between the ionosphere and magnetosphere at high latitudes [Inan et al., 1985; Lysak , 1991; Chaston, 2003; Streltsov and Lotko, 2008]. That fact makes these waves an object of intensive experimental and theoretical study, and a large number of experiments devoted to the artiﬁcial excitation of these waves in the magnetosphere from the ground-based facilities have been conducted in Europe, Rus-
80

sia, and the USA for more than 60 years. Comprehensive reviews of these experiments and their results can be found in Gurevich [2007] and Streltsov et al. [2018].
One of the most well-known and widely used methods of generation of ULF waves from the ground is heating the ionosphere with X-mode high-frequency (HF) waves. These waves increase the bulk temperature of the electron population in the ionospheric D and E regions. The variations in the electron temperature change the Hall and Pedersen conductances in the ionosphere. Ionospheric conductivity is directly proportional to the ions’ mobility. Studies and observations show that the ion mobility decreases by a factor of 1.4 or 2.0 when the ions are heated threefold or sevenfold by the perpendicular electric ﬁeld, respectively [Aikio et al., 2004; Paschmann et al., 2012]. If there is a large-scale electric ﬁeld in the ionosphere, then the changes in the conductances cause changes in the Hall and Pedersen currents ﬂowing in the ionosphere, which, in turn, generate magnetic ﬁeld-aligned current ﬂowing into the magnetosphere. This is a so-called Getmantsev’s eﬀect [Getmantsev et al., 1974], which was introduced in 1974 and extensively used after that in the high-latitude ionosphere-magnetosphere system. The auroral and subauroral zones are particularly favorable for this mechanism because, normally, there is a large-scale electric ﬁeld in the ionosphere associated with the electrojet [Stubbe and Kopka, 1977; Gurevich, 2011; Stubbe et al., 1981; Robinson et al., 1998].
If the frequency of the generated ULF waves matches one of the eigenfrequencies of the global magnetospheric resonator (formed by the entire magnetic ﬂux tube and bounded by the ionosphere), then these waves can form a standing pattern along the magnetic ﬁeld line between the conjugate hemispheres and reach large amplitudes after some time. Simulations by Streltsov et al. [2005]; Streltsov [2011] show that
81

a large-amplitude (in the order of 50 nT) ULF wave can be generated even by a relatively small ionospheric disturbance modulated with the eigenfrequency of the resonator.
Because the HF power available for the ionospheric modiﬁcation from ground transmitters is always limited, there are many theoretical and experimental studies devoted to the eﬃciency of how this power is used [Streltsov et al., 2018]. Two of the most eﬃcient methods described in the literature include “beam-painting” and geometric modulation techniques. The beam painting technique, suggested by Papadopoulos et al. [1989, 1990], means that the beam focuses in a small spot, which moves rapidly across some area in the ionosphere to heat electrons inside this area. The entire process is modulated with the frequency of the generated wave. The geometric modulation means that instead of heating one spot (or some area) in the ionosphere and turning the transmitter ON and OFF with the wave period, the transmitter sends a constant beam of HF power and moves it in the ionosphere along some particular geometrical path. The injection of ELF/VLF waves into the magnetosphere by the modulated heating of the electrojet by the High Altitude Active Research Program (HAARP) facility in Alaska has been extensively studied by Papadopoulos et al. [2003], Golkowski et al. [2008]; Golkowski et al. [2011], and Cohen et al. [2010].
Streltsov and Pedersen [2010] proposed a modiﬁcation to the geometric modulation technique. They suggest to move the heating spot in the ionosphere in the direction of the background electric ﬁeld with the phase speed of the feedback-unstable ULF wave. This suggestion was based on numerical simulations of the two-ﬂuid MHD model describing active ionospheric response (aka feedback) on the structure and am-

plitude of magnetospheric ﬁeld-aligned currents interacting with the ionosphere and modifying conductivity by precipitating electrons in it. The ionospheric feedback mechanism has been studied for almost 50 years [Atkinson, 1970]. The basic idea is that the ULF FAC changes the ionospheric conductivity (almost twofold from 2.0 mho to less than 0.5 mho) by precipitating/removing electrons into/from the E layer, and the variation in the conductivity “feed back” on the structure and amplitude of the incident FAC. When the large-scale electric ﬁeld exists in the ionosphere, the feedback may work in a constructive way and increase the amplitude of the ULF waves and the density disturbances on the ionosphere, which lead to instability.
Streltsov and Pedersen [2010] used the X-mode heating to trigger and enhance the ionospheric feedback instability by synchronizing the heating regime with the dynamics of the most feedback-unstable ULF mode. This idea had been implemented during 2014 BRIOCHE research campaign at HAARP and did not produce any positive results. There are several possible reasons why these particular experiments were not successful. Among them could be: the absence of the electrojet, the high density of the ionosphere above the HAARP, unknown information about ionospheric parameters in the magnetically conjugate location, etc. However, there is one particular shortage in the Streltsov and Pedersen [2010] model, which may signiﬁcantly compromise the applicability of the numerical results to real experiments. This shortage comes from the fact that the numerical model used was two-dimensional (with a one-dimensional ionosphere) and did not include eﬀects of the Hall current in the ionosphere. At the same time, the importance of the Hall current for the ionospheric feedback mechanism has been emphasized in almost every classical paper about the instability [e.g. Atkinson, 1970; Sato, 1978; Miura et al., 1982; Trakhtengerts and

5.2 Numerical Implementation and Boundary Conditions

The goal of this study is to eliminate the aforementioned shortage and investigate the eﬀects of the Hall current on the dynamics of the magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions involving the ionospheric feedback mechanism triggered and controlled by the artiﬁcial ionospheric heating. This study is based on a 3D reduced two-ﬂuid MHD (RMHD) model described in the previous chapter.
The ionospheric part consists of the modiﬁed density continuity equation

∂t eh

.

(5.1)

Eﬀect of the X-mode HF heating is modeled via a decrease in the coeﬃcient of the recombination in the E-region. It is speciﬁed by the function H(ρ), which is chosen as H(ρ) = 0.1 e−(ρ/ρ0)2. Here ρ is the distance in the ionosphere from the center of the heated spot (where the heater power maximizes), and ρ0 = 10 km is a half-width of the heated spot beam. The maximum amplitude of H at ρ = 0 is 0.1, which means that the heating changes the coeﬃcient of the recombination by 10%.
The latitudinal boundaries of the domain are formed by the L = 4.6 and L = 5.2 magnetic shells. The azimuthal size of the domain is φ = 1.91◦.
The background parameters of the model are similar to the typical parameters of the ionosphere-magnetosphere system considered in other studies, e.g., [Streltsov

and Pedersen, 2010]. The background density along the L = 4.9 magnetic ﬁeld line, whose ionospheric footprint corresponds to the HAARP location, is deﬁned as:

n0 =

 

b1e−20(r−r2)

+ b2r−4 + b3,

if r1 < r < r2 if r > r2.

(5.2)

Here r is the radial distance to point on the ﬁeld line, r1 = 1 + 100/Re, and r2 = 1 + 220/Re. The constants a1, a2, b1, b2 and b3 are parameters that satisfy a density of 1.00 × 104 cm−3 at E region altitude of 100 km, 2.63 × 105 cm−3 at F region altitude of 220 km and 129 cm−3 in the equatorial magnetosphere. The density of 1.00 × 104 cm−3 in the E region provides the height-integrated Pedersen conductivity of 0.32 mho. Inside the computational domain the density is assumed to be homogeneous in the direction perpendicular to the ambient magnetic ﬁeld. This is a reasonable assumption due to the relatively small perpendicular size of the domain (0.6 L shell in the L direction and less than 2◦ in the φ direction).
The background electric ﬁeld in the domain is deﬁned as E0 = −∇Φ, where Φ is the electric potential. In the ionosphere, the potential Φ is chosen to provide a uniform electric ﬁeld with a magnitude 20 mV/m pointed in the north-south direction. This electric potential remains constant along the ambient magnetic ﬁeld lines, so there is not any background parallel electric ﬁeld (or the parallel potential drop) present in the magnetosphere. This ﬁeld is comparable with the the background electric ﬁeld considered in 2D simulations of the ionospheric heating by Streltsov and Pedersen [2010].

5.3 Results and Discussion
Firstly, the main results from the 2D simulations by Streltsov and Pedersen [2010] are veriﬁed using a 3D model output. Namely, that the movement of the heating spot in the ionosphere with the phase velocity of the feedback-unstable mode leads to a generation of larger amplitude waves in a shorter time, than the heating of some stationary location in the ionosphere. To verify this result the 3D code is run with ΣH = 0. In the ﬁrst run, the heating was focused on a stationary spot in the ionosphere. The results from this run are shown in Figure 5.1. In particular, Figure 5.1a shows a snapshot of the parallel current density j , inside the 3D domain, at time

t = 651 s after the beginning of heating. Figure 1a shows the surfaces of j = 0.1 µA/m2 in red and surfaces of j = -0.1 µA/m2 in blue. Figure 1b shows the temporal dynamics of j measured at an altitude of 100 km in the Northern Hemisphere. Again, the red color is used to show the surfaces of j = 0.1 µA/m2 and the blue color is used to show the surfaces of j = -0.1 µA/m2. Figure 5.1 illustrates development of the ionospheric feedback instability driven by the uniform 20 mV/m electric ﬁeld and triggered by the constant heating of the ionosphere.
The results from this run had been used to estimate the phase velocity of the feedback-unstable waves in the ionosphere. Comparison of j in the ionosphere in several instances in time, shows that the waves generated by the instability propagate in the direction of the background electric ﬁeld (in this case it is the L direction) with a phase speed of ≈100 m/s. This value is equal to the phase velocity calculated from the linear dispersion relation given for the most unstable mode by Sato [1978], which for the parameters used in this study is ω/k⊥ = MP E⊥0/2 = 100 m/s.
To model the moving of the heating spot in the ionosphere, we make the H function in Eq. 5.1 depending on time, namely, H = H(vLt + L0, vφt + φ0), where vL and vφ are the wave front’s phase velocity components estimated from the simulation with stationary heating spot in the ionosphere. In case ΣH = 0, the L-component of the phase velocity in the ionosphere is 100 m/s and vφ = 0. Figure 5.2 illustrates a comparison between j obtained in the simulations with a stationary heating spot (left panels) and with a moving heating spot (right panels). In particular, Figures 5.2c and 5.2d show time evolution of j , in the Northern Hemisphere ionosphere, at a 2D longitudinal cut through the computational domain at L = 4.9 from t = 400 s to t = 651 s after the heater was turned on.
