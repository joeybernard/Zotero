The high-latitude ionosphericplasma has irregularities which range over many decadesof spatial scales frommetersto hundredsof kilometers[Tsunoda1, 988; Crowley,1996;Basuand Valladares1, 999].The largescalestructuresrangingfrom hundredsto thousandsof kilometershavebeencategorizedas "patches"(in the polarcap) or "blobs"(at aurorallatitudes)[Weberet al., 1984,1986;Basuet al., 1990,1994].The mesoscale

In Plate 3a, five different isosurfacesequally spaced between the normalized minimum density Nmin = 1 and the maximum density N•nax= 2 initially at t = 0 are displayed. In Plate 3b we showthe samefive isosurfacesfor simulationwith • = 10 at t = 36 (which correspondtso an hour in real time). There are various interesting featuresassociatedwith the structuring process.What is clearly evident is that the structuring occursthroughout the plasma patch. Sincewithin the framework of linear theory the instability only occurs in the region where the density gradient exists, one expectsthat the instability, evenin the nonlinearphase, will remain confined to the edgesof the plasma patch. However,the nonlineardevelopmentclearly showsthat
